'''Ansel Easton Adams''' ([[February 20]], [[1902]] – [[April 22]], [[1984]]) was a legendary [[United States|American]] [[photographer]] and [[environmentalist]], best known for his [[black-and-white]] photographs of the [[American West]] and primarily [[Yosemite National Park]]. 

For his images, he developed the [[zone system]] of photography, a way to calculate the proper exposure of a photograph. The resulting clarity and depth were characteristic of his photographs. His crystal clear images were also the result of his using the large format 8&quot; x 10&quot; film camera, which provided a maximum resolution, although it was among the most difficult cameras to use due to its large size, weight, set-up time, and film cost. However, it was typical of the lengths he would go to achieve his vision of perfection.

He founded the &quot;f/64 group&quot; along with fellow photographers [[Edward Weston]] and [[Imogen Cunningham]], which was responsible for the founding of the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s department of photography. Adams' timeless and visually stunning photographs are constantly reproduced on calendars, posters, and in books, making his photographs widely recognizable. And as a result, his images are among the most significant and familiar contributions to the history of photography.

==Life==

=== Childhood ===

Adams was born in the Western Addition of [[San Francisco]], [[California]] to distinctly [[upper-class]] parents Charles and Olive Adams.  He was an only child and was named after his uncle Ansel Easton. The Adams family came from New England, having migrated from the north of Ireland in the early 1700s but were not connected with the Presidential Adams family.  His grandfather founded and built a prosperous lumber business, which his father later ran, though his father’s natural talents lay more with sciences than with business.  Later in life, Adams would condemn that very same industry for cutting down many of the great redwood forests.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, Mary Street, 1996. ''Ansel Adams: a Biography''. New York: Henry Holt and Co. ISBN 0-8050-4116-8, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother’s family came from Baltimore and his maternal grandfather had a successful freight-hauling business but squandered his wealth in failed mining and real estate ventures in Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;Ansel Adams, 1983a. ''Ansel Adams: An Autobiography''. Boston: Little, Brown and Co. ISBN 0-8212-1596-5, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ansel Adams, 1980.jpg|thumb|right|263px|'''Ansel Adams''' at [[Big Sur]], 1980.]]
Ansel Adams was born in his parents' bed. When he was four years old, he was tossed face-first into a garden wall during an [[aftershock]] from the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], breaking his nose.  Among his earliest memories was watching the ensuing fire that destroyed much of the city a few miles away. His left-leaning broken nose was never corrected and remained crooked for his entire life.&lt;ref name=SierraClubBio&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sierraclub.org/ansel_adams/about.asp|title = Sierra Club Biography|accessmonthday = February 12|accessyear = 2007|publisher = Sierra Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams was a hyperactive child and prone to frequent sickness. He had few friends but his family home and surroundings on the heights facing San Francisco Bay provided ample childhood activities.  He hadn’t the patience for games or sports but the curious child took to nature at an early age, collecting bugs and exploring the nearby beach.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 1983a, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; His father bought a telescope and they shared the hobby enthusiastically. His parents raised him to follow the ideals of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], to live a modest, moral life guided by a social responsibility to man and to nature.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his grandfather and the aftermath of the [[Panic of 1907]], his father’s business suffered great financial losses and by 1912, the family’s standard of living had dropped sharply.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; After young Ansel was dismissed from several private schools for his restlessness and inattentiveness, his father decided to pull him out of school in 1915, at the age of 12. Adams was then educated by private tutors, his Aunt Mary, and by his father.  During the [[Panama-Pacific International Exposition]] in 1915, his father insisted that, as part of his education, Adams spend a good part of each day studying the exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 1983a, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; After a while, Adams resumed and then completed his formal education by attending another private school until eighth grade.

Music became the main focus of his later youth. Possessing a photographic memory, Adams quickly learned to read music and play the piano. Through a series of dedicated piano teachers, the regime of grueling piano exercises and strict discipline quieted his hyperactivity and his musical skills blossomed. Music also provided the channeled emotional outlet he had craved.  He applied himself seriously toward becoming a concert pianist.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 1983a, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; 

Adams first visited [[Yosemite|Yosemite National Park]] in 1916 with his family. The famous valley was the first place in the United States to be designated a protected nature area by a Congressional act, signed by [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote of his first view of the valley which so inspired him, “the splendor of Yosemite burst upon us and it ''was'' glorious...One wonder after another descended upon us...There was light everywhere...A new era began for me.&quot; His father gave him his first camera, a Kodak [[Brownie (camera)|Brownie box camera]], during that stay and he took his first photographs with his “usual hyperactive enthusiasm”.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 1983a, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Yosemite on his own the following year with better cameras and a tripod.  In the winter, he learned basic darkroom technique working part-time for a San Francisco photo finisher.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Adams avidly read photography magazines, attended camera club meetings, and went to photography and art exhibits.  With his Uncle Frank he explored the High Sierra, in summer and winter, developing the stamina and skill needed to photograph at high altitude and under difficult weather conditions.

[[Image:Adams Leaf In Glacier National Park.jpg|thumb|left|Close-up of leaves ''In Glacier National Park'' (1942)]]
While in Yosemite, he had frequent contact with the Best family, owners of Best's Studio, who allowed him to practice on their old square piano. In 1928, Ansel Adams married Virginia Best in Best's Studio in Yosemite Valley. Virginia inherited the studio from her artist father on his death in 1935, and the Adams continued to operate the studio until 1971. The studio, now known as the Ansel Adams Gallery, remains in the hands of the Adams family.

At age 17, Adams joined the [[Sierra Club]], a group dedicated to preserving the natural world's wonders and resources, and he was the custodian of the organization’s headquarters at Yosemite, for four years.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 1983a, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a member throughout his lifetime and served as a director, as did his wife. Adams participated in the club's annual &quot;high trips&quot;, and was later responsible for several [[first ascent]]s in the Sierra Nevada. During 1919, he contracted the lethal influenza which ravaged the world and fell seriously ill but recovered after several months to resume his outdoor life.

During his twenties, most of his friends came from musical connections, particularly violinist and amateur photographer Cedric Wright, who became his best friend as well as his philosophical and cultural mentor.  Their shared philosophy came from [[Edward Carpenter]]’s ''Toward Democracy'', a literary work which espoused the pursuit of beauty in life and art.  Adams always carried a pocket edition with him while at Yosemite.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; It soon became his personal philosophy as well, as Adams later stated, “I believe in beauty. I believe in stones and water, air and soil, people and their future and their fate.”&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 1983a, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He decided that the purpose of his art from now on, whether photography or music, was to reveal that beauty to others and to inspire them to the same calling.

In summer, Adams would enjoy a life of hiking, camping, and photographing, and the rest of the year he worked to improve his piano playing, expanding his piano technique and musical expression.  He also gave piano lessons to make some income, finally affording a grand piano suitable to his musical ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 1983a, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; His first photographs were published in 1921 and Best’s Studio began selling his Yosemite prints the following year. His early photos already showed careful composition and sensitivity to tonal balance.  In letters and cards to family, he also expresses his daring to climb to the best view points and brave the worst elements.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder and Stillman, 1988. ''Ansel Adams: Letters and Images 1916-1984''. Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co. ISBN 0-8212-1691-0, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, however, Adams was still planning a career in music, even though his small hands, easily bruised by bravura playing, limited his repertoire to practiced works which benefited from his strengths of fine touch and excellent musicality.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 1983a, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; It took seven more years, though, for Adams to finally concede that at best he might become a concert pianist of limited range, an accompanist, or a piano teacher.

In the mid-1920s, Adams experimented with soft-focus, etching, bromoil, and other techniques of the pictorial photographers, such as [[Photo-Secession]] leader [[Alfred Stieglitz]] who strived to emulate [[Impressionism]] and tried to put photography on an equal artistic plane with painting by trying to mimic it.  However, Adams steered clear of hand-coloring which was also popular at the time. Adams used a variety of lenses to get different effects, but eventually rejected pictorialism for a more realist approach which relied more heavily on sharp focus, heightened contrast, precise exposure, and darkroom craftsmanship.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, pp. 38–42&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1927, Adams contracted for his first portfolio, in his new style, which included his famous image ''Monolith'',  the vertical western face of [[Half Dome]] taken with his Korona view camera utilizing glass plates and a dark red filter (to heighten the tonal contrasts).  On that excursion, he had only one plate left and he “visualized” the effect of the blackened sky before risking the last shot.  As he wrote, “I had been able to realize a desired image: not the way the subject appeared in reality but how it ''felt'' to me and how it must appear in the finished print”.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 1983a, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; As he wrote confidently in April, 1927, “My photographs have now reached a stage when they are worthy of the world’s critical examination.  I have suddenly come upon a new style which I believe will place my work equal to anything of its kind.”&lt;ref&gt;Alinder and Stillman, 1988, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

With the sponsorship and promotion of Albert Bender, an arts-connected businessman, Adams’s first portfolio was a success (earning nearly $4,000) and soon he received commercial assignments to photograph the wealthy patrons who bought his portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Adams also came to understand how important it was that his carefully crafted photos were reproduced to best effect. At Bender’s invitation, he joined the prestigious Roxburghe Club, an association devoted to fine printing and high standards in book arts.  He learned much about printing techniques, inks, design, and layout which he later applied to other projects.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, at that time, most of his darkroom work was still being done in the basement of his parent’s home, and he was somewhat limited by barely adequate equipment.

After a cooling off period with Virginia Best during 1925–6, during which he had short-lasting relationships with various women, many of them students of his mentor Cedric Wright, he married Virginia in 1928.  The newlyweds moved in with his parents to save expenses. His marriage also marked the end of his serious attempt at a musical career, as well as her ambitions to be a classical singer.

Between 1929 and 1942, Adams’ works became more mature and he became more established. In the course of his 60-year career, the 1930s were a particularly productive and experimental time. Adams expanded his works, focusing on detailed close-ups as well as large forms from mountains to factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/24185/ansel-adams-at-the-phoenix-art-museum/|title = Ansel Adams at the Phoenix Art Museum|publisher = ARTINFO|accessmonthday = November 29|accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 [[Taos Pueblo]], Adams second portfolio, was published with text by writer Mary Austin.  In New Mexico, he was introduced to notables from Stieglitz’s circle, including wife [[Georgia O’Keeffe]], artist [[John Marin]], and photographer [[Paul Strand]], all of whom created famous works during their stays in the Southwest. Adams’s talkative, high-spirited nature combined with his excellent piano playing made him a hit within his enlarging circle of elite artist friends.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; Strand especially proved influential, sharing secrets of his technique with Adams, and finally convincing Adams to pursue photography with all his talent and energy.  One of Strand’s suggestions which Adams immediately adopted was to use glossy paper rather than matte to intensify tonal values.

Through a friend with Washington connections Adams was able to put on his first solo museum exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution in 1931, featuring 60 prints taken in the High Sierra. He received an excellent review from the Washington Post, “His photographs are like portraits of the giant peaks, which seem to be inhabited by mythical gods”.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his success, Adams felt he was not yet up to the standards of Strand.  He decided to broaden his subject matter to include still life and close-up photos, and to achieve higher quality by “visualizing” each image before taking it.  He emphasized the use of small apertures and long exposures in natural light, which created sharp details with a wide range of focus, as demonstrated in ''Rose and Driftwood'' (1933), one of his finest still-life photographs.

In 1932, Adams had a group show at the [[M. H. de Young Museum]] with [[Imogen Cunningham]] and [[Edward Weston]] and they soon formed [[Group f/64]], which espoused “pure or straight photography” over [[pictorialism]] (f/64 being a very small [[aperture]] setting that gives great [[depth of field]]).  The group’s manifesto stated that “Pure photography is defined as possessing no qualities of technique, composition or idea, derivative of any other art form”.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, “pure photography” did borrow from some of the established principles of painting, especially compositional balance and perspective, and some manipulation of subject and effect.  By these standards, not only were “soft focus” lenses prohibited but Adams earlier photo “Monolith”, which used a strong red filter to create a black sky, would have been considered unacceptable.

Following Stieglitz’s example, in 1933 Adams opened his own art and photography gallery in San Francisco which eventually became the Danysh Gallery after Adams commitments grew too burdensome.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 1983a, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Adams also began to publish essays in photography magazines and wrote his first instructional book ''Making a Photograph'' in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; During the summers, he often participated in Sierra Club outings, as a paid photographer for the group, and the rest of the year a core group of the Club members socialized regularly in San Francisco. During 1933, his first child Michael was born, followed by Anne two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, many photographers including [[Dorothea Lange]] and [[Walker Evans]] believed they had a social obligation to reveal the harsh times of the Depression through their art.  Mostly resistant to the “art for life’s sake” movement, Adams did begin in the 1930s to deploy his photographs in the cause of wilderness preservation. In part, he was inspired by the increasing desecration of Yosemite Valley by commercial development, including a pool hall, bowling alley, golf course, shops, and automobile traffic. He created a limited-edition book in 1938, ''Sierra Nevada: The John Muir Trail'', as part of the Sierra Club's efforts to secure the designation of [[Sequoia National Park|Sequoia]] and [[Kings Canyon National Park|Kings Canyon]] as national parks. This book and his testimony before Congress played a vital role in the success of the effort, and Congress designated the area as a National Park in 1940.  

In 1935, Adams created many new photos of the Sierra and one of his most famous photographs, ''Clearing Winter Storm'', captured the entire valley just as a winter storm relented, leaving a fresh coat of snow.  After courting Stieglitz for three years, Adams gathered his recent work and had a solo show at the Stieglitz gallery “An American Place” in New York in 1936. The exhibition proved successful with both the critics and the buying public, and earned Adams strong praise from the revered Stieglitz.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; During the balance of the 1930s, Adams took on many commercial assignments to supplement the income from the struggling Best’s Studio.  Until the 1970s, Adams was dependent on commercial projects to make ends meet.  Some of his clients included Kodak, Fortune magazine, Pacific Gas and Electric, AT&amp;T, and the American Trust Company.  In 1939, he was named an editor of [[U.S. Camera]], the most popular photography magazine at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Ansel put together ''A Pageant of Photography'', the most important and largest photography show in the West to date, attended by millions of visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; With his wife, Adams completed a children’s book and the very successful ''Illustrated Guide to Yosemite Valley'' during 1940 and 1941. Adams also began his first serious stint of teaching in 1941 at the Art Center School of Los Angeles, which included the training of military photographers.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 1983a, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Adams had a camera platform mounted on his car, to afford him a better vantage point over the immediate foreground and a better angle for expansive backgrounds.  Most of his landscapes from that time forward were made from his car rather than from summits reached by rugged hiking, as in his earlier days.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

On a trip in New Mexico weeks before the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Adams shot a scene of the Moon rising above a modest village with snow-covered mountains in the background, under a dominating black sky. The photograph is one of his most famous and is named, ''Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico''. The photograph’s fame was probably enhanced by Adams’s description in his later books&lt;ref&gt;
Ansel Adams, 1981. ''The Negative''. Boston: New York Graphic Society. ISBN 0-8212-1131-5, p. 127
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Adams, 1983a, pp. 273–275
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Ansel Adams, 1983b. ''Examples: The Making of 40 Photographs''. Boston: New York Graphic Society. ISBN 0-8212-1750-X, pp. 40–43
&lt;/ref&gt;
of how it was made: the light on the crosses in the foreground was rapidly fading, and he could not find his exposure meter; however, he remembered the [[luminance]] of the Moon, and used it to calculate the proper exposure. Adams’s earlier account&lt;ref&gt;
T.J. Maloney, ed., 1942. ''U.S. Camera 1943'' annual. New York: Duell, Sloan &amp;amp; Pearce, pp. 88–89
&lt;/ref&gt; was less dramatic, stating simply that the photograph was made after sunset, with exposure determined using his Weston Master meter.&lt;ref&gt;
Alinder, 1996, p. 192, states that the image caption for ''Moonrise'' in ''U.S. Camera 1943'' was inaccurate, citing discrepancies in several technical details.
&lt;/ref&gt;
However the exposure was actually determined, the foreground was underexposed, the highlights in the clouds were quite dense, and the negative proved difficult to print.&lt;ref&gt;
Adams, 1983b, p. 42
&lt;/ref&gt;
Over nearly 40 years, Adams re-interpreted the image, his most popular by far, using the latest darkroom equipment at his disposal, making over 1300 unique prints, most in 16&amp;Prime; by 20&amp;Prime; format. &lt;ref name=5pr&gt; [http://www.andrewsmithgallery.com/exhibitions/Arrington_adams/index.html 5 prints of &quot;Moonrise&quot;, 1941-1975] &lt;/ref&gt; Many of the prints were made in the 1970s, finally giving Adams financial independence from commercial projects. The total value of  these original prints exceeds $25,000,000;&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, pp. 185–199&lt;/ref&gt; the highest price paid for a single print reached  $609,600 at Sotheby's New York auction in 2006.

In September 1941, Adams contracted&lt;ref&gt;
Peter Wright and John Armor, 1988. ''The Mural Project''. Santa Barbara, California: Reverie Press ISBN 1-55824-162-0, p. vi. Although verbal agreement was given on [[September 30]], [[1941]], the contract was actually approved on [[November 3]] and backdated to [[October 14]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
with the [[Department of the Interior]] to make photographs of National Parks, Indian reservations, and other locations for use as mural-sized prints for decoration of the Department’s new building.  Part of his understanding with the Department was that he might also make photographs for his own use, using his own film and processing. Although Adams kept meticulous records of his travel and expenses,&lt;ref&gt;
Wright and Armor, 1989, p. vi
&lt;/ref&gt;
he was less disciplined about recording the dates of his images, and neglected to note the date of ''Moonrise'', so it was not clear whether it belonged to Adams or to the U.S. Government. But the position of the Moon allowed the image to eventually be dated from astronomical calculations, and it was determined that ''Moonrise'' was made on [[November 1]], [[1941]],&lt;ref&gt;
Sean Callahan, 1981. “Short Takes: Countdown to Moonrise,” ''American Photographer'', January 1981, pp. 30–31. David Elmore of the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder, Colorado, determined that ''Moonrise'' was taken on [[October 31]], [[1941]], at 4:03 P.M.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Dennis di Cicco, 1991. “Dating Ansel Adams’ Moonrise,” ''Sky &amp; Telescope'', November 1991, pp. 529–533. Di Cicco noticed that the Moon’s position at the time Elmore had determined did not match the Moon’s position in the image, and after an independent analysis, determined the time to be 4:49:20 P.M. on [[November 1]], [[1941]]. He reviewed his results with Elmore, who agreed with di Cicco’s conclusions. 
&lt;/ref&gt;
a day for which he had not billed the Department, so the image belonged to Adams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alinder1996-p.201&quot;&gt;
Alinder, 1996, p. 201
&lt;/ref&gt;
The same was not true for many of his other negatives, including ''The Tetons and the Snake River'', which, having been made for the Mural Project, became the property of the U.S. Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alinder1996-p.201&quot;/&gt;

Adams was distressed by the [[Japanese American Internment]] that occurred after the [[Pearl Harbor]] attack. He requested permission to visit the [[Manzanar War Relocation Center]] in the [[Owens Valley]], at the foot of [[Mount Williamson]]. The resulting photo-essay first appeared in a [[Museum of Modern Art]] exhibit, and later was published as ''[[Born Free and Equal|Born Free and Equal: The Story of Loyal Japanese-Americans]]''.  He also contributed to the war effort by doing many photographic assignments for the military, including making prints of secret Japanese installations in the Aleutians.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Adams was the recipient of three [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim]] fellowships during his career, the first in 1946 to photograph every National Park.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; This series of photographs produced memorable images of “Old Faithful Geyser”, [[Grand Teton]], and [[Mount McKinley]].

In 1952 Adams was one of the founders of the magazine ''[[Aperture (magazine)|Aperture]]'', which was intended as a serious journal of photography showcasing its best practitioners and newest innovations. He was also a  contributor to ''[[Arizona Highways]]'', a photo-rich travel magazine which continues today.  His article on ''[[Mission San Xavier del Bac]]'', with text by longtime friend [[Nancy Newhall]],  was enlarged into a book published in 1954.  This was the first of many collaborations with her.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1955, Adams began his annual workshops, teaching thousands of students until 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 1983a, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s, Adams came to believe that he was on the down side of his creative life.  He continued with commercial assignments for another twenty years and became a consultant on a monthly retainer for Polaroid Corporation, founded by good friend [[Edwin Land]].&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; He made thousands of photographs with Polaroid products, ''El Capitan, Winter, Sunrise'' (1968) being the one he considered his most memorable. In the final twenty years of his life, the Hasselblad was his camera of choice, with ''Moon and Half Dome'' (1960) being his favorite photo made with that brand of camera.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 1983a, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1963, Ansel Adams and Nancy Newhall accepted a commission from [[Clark Kerr]], the President of the [[University of California]], to produce a series of photographs of the University's campuses to commemorate its centennial celebration. The collection, titled ''Fiat Lux'' after the University's motto, was published in 1967 and now resides in the Museum of Photography at the [[University of California, Riverside]].

In 1974, Adams had a major retrospective exhibition at the ''[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]''.  Much of his time during the 1970s was spent curating and re-printing negatives from his vault, in part to satisfy the great demand of art museums which had finally created departments of photography and desired his iconic works.  He also devoted his considerable writing skills and prestige to the cause of environmentalism, focusing particularly on the  ''[[Big Sur]]'' coastline of California and the protection of Yosemite from over-use.  President Carter commissioned Adams to make the first official portrait of a president made by a photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, pp. 294–295&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contributions and influence ===
Romantic landscapists [[Albert Bierstadt]] and [[Thomas Moran]] portrayed the [[Grand Canyon]] and [[Yosemite]] at the end of their reign, and were subsequently displaced by daredevil photographers Carleton Watkins, [[Eadweard Muybridge]], and George Fiske.&lt;ref&gt;Alinder, 1996, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  But it was his black-and-white photographs of the West which became the foremost record of what many of the National Parks were like before tourism, and his persistent advocacy helped expand the National Park system.  He skillfully used his works to promote many of the goals of the Sierra Club and of the nascent environmental movement, but always insisted that, as far as his photographs were concerned, “beauty comes first”.  His stirring images are still very popular in calendars, posters, and books.

Realistic about development and the subsequent loss of habitat, Adams advocated for balanced growth, but was pained by the ravages of “progress”. He stated, “We all know the tragedy of the dustbowls, the cruel unforgivable erosions of the soil, the depletion of fish or game, and the shrinking of the noble forests.  And we know that such catastrophes shrivel the spirit of the people…The wilderness is pushed back, man is everywhere.  Solitude, so vital to the individual man, is almost nowhere.” &lt;ref&gt;Adams, 1983a, pp. 290–291&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Adams co-founded [[Group f/64]] with other masters like [[Edward Weston]], [[Willard Van Dyke]], and [[Imogen Cunningham]]. With [[Fred Archer (photographer)|Fred Archer]], he pioneered the ''[[zone system]]'', a technique for translating perceived light into specific densities on negatives and paper, giving photographers better control over finished photographs. Adams also advocated the idea of ''visualization'' (which he often called ‘previsualization’, though he later acknowledged that term to be [[Redundancy (language)| a redundancy]]) whereby the final image is “seen” in the mind’s eye before taking the photo, toward the goal of achieving all together the aesthetic, intellectual, spiritual, and mechanical effects desired. He taught these and other techniques to thousands of amateur photographers through his publications and his workshops. His many books about photography, including the Morgan &amp; Morgan Basic Photo Series (''The Camera'', ''The Negative'', ''The Print'', ''Natural Light Photography'', and ''Artificial Light Photography'') have become classics in the field.  

He was elected in 1966 a [[fellow]] of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. In 1980 [[Jimmy Carter]] awarded him the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the nation's highest civilian honor.

[[Image:Adams The Tetons and the Snake River.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''The Tetons and the Snake River'' (1942)]] Adams's photograph ''The Tetons and the Snake River'' has the distinction of being one of the 115 images recorded on the [[Voyager Golden Record]] aboard the Voyager spacecraft. These images were selected to convey  information about humans, plants and animals, and geological features of the Earth to a possible alien civilization.  These photographs eloquently mirror his favorite saying, a Gaelic mantra, which states “I know that I am one with beauty and that my comrades are one.  Let our souls be mountains, Let our spirits be stars, Let our hearts be worlds.”&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 1983a, p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

His lasting legacy includes helping to elevate photography to an art comparable with painting and music, and equally capable of expressing emotion and beauty.  As he reminded his students, “It is easy to take a photograph, but it is harder to make a masterpiece in photography than in any other art medium”.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 1983a, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Ansel Adams,&quot; wrote John Szarkowski, of the N.Y. Museum of Modern Art, &quot;attuned himself more precisely than any photographer before him to a visual understanding of the specific quality of the light that fell on a specific place at a specific moment. For Adams the natural landscape is not a fixed and solid sculpture but an insubstantial image, as transient as the light that continually redifines it. This sensibility to the specificity of light was the motive that forced Adams to develop his legendary photographic technique.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Szarkowski, John, ''Looking at Photographs'', (1976) N.Y. Graphics Society Books&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
Ansel Adams died on [[April 22]], [[1984]], at age 82 from heart failure aggravated by cancer. When he died he left behind his wife, two children (Michael born August 1933, Anne born 1935) and five grandchildren.

Publishing rights for the Adams' photographs are handled by the trustees of The Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust.

The Minarets Wilderness in the [[Inyo National Forest]] was renamed the [[Ansel Adams Wilderness]] in 1985 in his honor. [[Mount Ansel Adams]], an {{convert|11760|ft|m|abbr=on}} peak in the Sierra Nevada, was named for him in 1985.

The full archive of Ansel Adams' work is located at the [[Center for Creative Photography]] (CCP) at the [[University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]].

John Szarkowski states in the introduction to ''Ansel Adams: Classic Images'' (1985, p. 5), &quot;The love that Americans poured out for the work and person of Ansel Adams during his old age, and that they have continued to express with undiminished enthusiasm since his death, is an extraordinary phenomenon, perhaps even unparalleled in our country's response to a visual artist&quot;.

{{Portal|Musical Theatre}}
'''Musical theatre''' is a form of [[theatre]] combining [[music]], [[song]]s, spoken [[dialogue]] and [[dance]].  The emotional content of the piece&amp;nbsp;– humor, pathos, love, anger&amp;nbsp;– as well as the story itself, is communicated through the words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole.  Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, &quot;musicals&quot;.

Musicals are performed around the world.  They may be presented in large venues, such as big budget [[West End theatre|West End]] and [[Broadway theatre]] productions in [[London]] and [[New York City]], or in smaller [[Fringe Theatre]], [[Off-Broadway]] or regional productions, on tour, or by amateur groups in schools, theatres and other performance spaces.  In addition to Britain and North America, there are vibrant musical theatre scenes in many countries in Europe, South America and Asia.

&lt;!-- Please DO NOT ADD new names to the following list.

Some famous musicals include ''[[Show Boat]]'', ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[West Side Story]]'', ''[[The Fantasticks]]'', ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', ''[[A Chorus Line]]'', ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', and ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]''. &lt;!-- Please DO NOT ADD new names to the above list.

Make any suggestions for changes or updates on the talk page.  --&gt;

== Definitions == &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The Addams Family]] --&gt;
The three main components of a musical are the music, the lyrics, and the book. The '''book''' of a musical refers to the &quot;[[Play (theatre)|play]]&quot; or story of the show&amp;nbsp;– in effect its spoken (not sung) lines; however, &quot;book&quot; can also refer to the dialogue and lyrics together, which are sometimes referred to (as in opera) as the [[libretto]] ([[Italian language|Italian]] for “little book”).  The '''music''' and '''lyrics''' together form the '''score''' of the musical.  The interpretation of the musical by the creative team heavily influences the way that the musical is presented.  The creative team includes a [[theatre director|director]], a [[musical director]] and usually a [[choreographer]].  A musical's production is also creatively characterized by technical aspects, such as set, [[costumes]], stage properties, lighting, etc. that generally change from production to production (although some famous production aspects tend to be retained from the original production, for example, [[Bob Fosse]]'s choregraphy in ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'').

There is no fixed length for a musical, and it can range from a short one-act entertainment to several acts and several hours in length (or even a multi-evening presentation); however, most musicals range from one and a half hours to three hours. Musicals today are typically presented in two acts, with one [[intermission]] ten to 20 minutes in length.  The first act is almost always somewhat longer than the second act, and generally introduces most of the music. A musical may be built around 4-6 main theme tunes that are reprised throughout the show, or consist of a series of songs not directly musically related.  Spoken dialogue is generally interspersed between musical numbers, although the use of &quot;sung dialogue&quot; or [[recitative]] is not unknown, especially in so-called &quot;sung-through&quot; musicals such as ''Les Misérables'' and ''Evita''.

[[Image:GaietyGirlDudleyHardy.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' (1893) was one of the first hit musicals.]]Musical theatre is closely related to another theatrical performance art, [[opera]].  These forms are usually distinguished by weighing a number of factors.  Musicals generally have a greater focus on spoken dialogue (though some musicals are entirely accompanied and sung through, such as ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and ''Les Misérables''; and on the other hand some operas, such as ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'', and most operettas, have some unaccompanied dialogue), on dancing (particularly by the principal performers as well as the chorus), on the use of various genres of [[popular music]] (or at least popular singing styles), and on the avoidance of certain operatic conventions.

In particular, a musical is almost never performed in any but the language of its audience. Musicals produced in London or New York, for instance, are invariably sung in English, even if they were originally written in another language (again, ''Les Misérables'', originally written in French, is a good example).

While an opera singer is primarily a singer and only secondarily an actor, a musical theatre singer is usually an actor first, who can at least hold a tune and &quot;put over&quot; a song, but is often not a professional singer as such.  Composers of music for musicals often have to take the limitations of such performers into account, and theatres staging musicals generally use [[amplifier|amplification]] of the actors' singing voices in a way that would normally be disapproved of in an operatic context.

In isolation, at least, none of these features is truly &quot;defining&quot;, and in practice it is often difficult to distinguish among the various kinds of light musical theatre, including &quot;[[operetta]]&quot;, &quot;[[comic opera]]&quot;, &quot;[[light opera]]&quot;, &quot;[[burletta]]&quot;, &quot;musical play&quot;, &quot;musical comedy&quot;, &quot;[[extravaganza]]&quot;, &quot;[[burlesque]]&quot;, &quot;[[travesty]]&quot;, &quot;[[music hall]]&quot;, and even &quot;[[revue]]&quot;.  Some works (e.g. by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Stephen Sondheim]]) have received both &quot;musical theatre&quot; and &quot;operatic&quot; treatment.  Similarly, some older operettas or light operas (such as ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]) have had modern productions or adaptations that treated them as musicals. [[Stephen Sondheim|Sondheim]] said:
&quot;I really think that when something plays Broadway it's a musical, and when it plays in an opera house it's opera. That's it. It's the terrain, the countryside, the expectations of the audience that make it one thing or another.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sondheim.org/php/news.php?id=1517 Sondheim website]&lt;/ref&gt;  This article primarily concerns musical theatre works that are distinctively &quot;non-operatic&quot;, but there inescapably remains some overlap between lighter operatic forms and the more musically complex or ambitious musicals: a grey area, in which production styles are almost as important as actual musical or dramatic content in defining into which art form the piece falls.

As with a well-crafted operetta or opera, a &quot;book&quot; musical's moments of greatest dramatic intensity are often performed in song. Proverbially, &quot;when the emotion becomes too strong for speech (or [[recitative]]) you sing; when it becomes too strong for song, you dance.&quot; A song is ideally crafted to suit the character (or characters) and their situation within the story; although there have been times in the history of the musical (e.g. the 1890s and 1920s) when this integration between music and story has been tenuous.  As ''[[New York Times]]'' critic Ben Brantley described the ideal of song in theatre in reviewing the 2008 revival of ''Gypsy'', &quot;There is no separation at all between song and character, which is what happens in those uncommon moments when musicals reach upward to achieve their ideal reasons to be.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater2.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/theater/reviews/28gyps.html?pagewanted=2 Brantley, Ben.  &quot;Curtain Up! It’s Patti’s Turn&quot;, ''New York Times'', March 28, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

A show often opens with a song that sets the tone of the musical, introduces some or all of the major characters, and shows the setting of the play. Within the compressed nature of the musical, the writers must develop the characters and the plot.  Music provides a means to express emotion. However, typically, many fewer words are sung in a five-minute song than are spoken in a five-minute block of dialogue. Therefore there is less time to develop drama than in a straight play of equivalent length, since a musical usually devotes more time to music than to dialogue.

Many familiar musical theatre works have been the basis for popular [[musical movie|musical films]], such as ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'', and ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''  or were adapted or even written for [[television]] presentations (for example [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (TV)|Cinderella]]''). Recently, some popular television programs have set an episode in the style of a musical.  There has also been a recent revival of the movie musical, such as the 2002 film, ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'', based on the 1975 stage musical.  Similarly, India produces numerous musical films, referred to as &quot;[[Bollywood]]&quot; musicals, and Japan produces a considerable number of [[Anime]] musicals.  Conversely, there has been a trend in recent decades to adapt musicals from the screen to the stage, both from popular animated film musicals, such as ''[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'', and live-action films, such as ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' and ''[[The Color Purple (musical)|The Color Purple]]''.

== History ==
=== Ancient Greece and middle ages ===
Musical theatre in Europe dates back to the [[theatre]] of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], who included music and dance in their stage comedies and tragedies as early as the 5th century B.C.&lt;ref name=guide&gt;[http://www.tuts.com/season07/wonderful_study.pdf Study guide history of musical theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] even composed their own music to accompany their plays.  The Third Century B.C. [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] comedies of [[Plautus]] included song and dance routines performed with orchestrations.  The popularity of theatre declined somewhat in the [[Roman Empire]], but some innovations were made: to make the dance steps more audible in large open air theatres, Roman actors attached metal chips called &quot;sabilla&quot; to their stage footwear&amp;nbsp;– the first tap shoes.&lt;ref&gt;See Denny Martin Flynn, ''Musical: A Grand Tour'' (New York: Schirmer Books, 1997), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Middle Ages, performers travelled from town to town trying to find an audience.  At times, they were barred, as it was feared that they brought the plague.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;  In the 12th and 13th centuries, religious dramas, such as ''The Play of Herod'' and ''The Play of Daniel'' taught the liturgy, set to church chants.  To teach the Latin bible to illiterate masses, [[cycle play]]s were created that told a biblical story divided into entertaining parts.  Several [[pageant wagon]]s (stages on wheels) would move about the city, and a group of actors would tell their part of the story.  Once finished, the group would move on with their wagon, and the next group would arrive to tell its part of the story.  These plays developed into an autonomous form of musical theatre, with poetic forms sometimes alternating with the prose dialogues and liturgical chants.  The poetry was provided with modified or completely new melodies.&lt;ref&gt;See Rochard H. Hoppin, ''Medieval Music'' (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co, 1978), pp. 180-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance to the 1700s ===
The [[Renaissance]] saw these forms evolve into [[commedia dell'arte]], an Italian tradition where raucous clowns improvised their way through familiar stories, and from there, [[opera buffa]].  [[Molière]] turned several of his farcical comedies into musical entertainments with songs (music provided by [[Jean Baptiste Lully]]) and dance in the late 1600s.  Arts of all kinds became widely popular, including musical theatre.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;

[[Image:William Hogarth 016.jpg|thumb|250px|Painting based on ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', Scene V, [[William Hogarth]], c. 1728]]By the 1700s, two forms of musical theatre were popular in Britain, France and Germany: [[ballad operas]], like [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' (1728), that included lyrics written to the tunes of popular songs of the day (often spoofing opera), and [[comic opera]]s, with original scores and mostly romantic plot lines, like [[Michael Balfe]]'s ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'' (1845).  Other musical theatre forms developed by the 19th century, such as [[vaudeville]], British [[music hall]], [[melodrama]] and [[burlesque (genre)|burlesque]].  Melodramas and burlettas, in particular, were popularized partly because most London theatres were licensed only as music halls and not allowed to present plays without music.  In any event, what a piece was called did not necessarily define what it was.  The Broadway [[extravaganza]] ''The Magic Deer'' (1852) advertised itself as &quot;A Serio Comico Tragico Operatical Historical Extravaganzical Burletical Tale of Enchantment.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kenrick&gt;[http://www.musicals101.com/erastage.htm Article on the Musicals 101 website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded long running play of any kind was ''The Beggar's Opera'', which ran for 62 successive performances in 1728.  It would take almost a century before the first play broke 100 performances, with ''Tom and Jerry'', based on the book ''Life in London'' (1821), and the record soon reached 150 in the late 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-longr.html Article on long-running musicals before 1920]&lt;/ref&gt;

New York (and so, America) did not have a significant theatre presence until 1752, when [[William Hallam]] sent a company of twelve actors to the colonies with his brother Lewis as their manager. They established a theatre in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] and opened with ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' and ''The Anatomist.'' The company moved to New York in the summer of 1753, performing ballad-operas such as ''The Beggar’s Opera'' and ballad-farces like ''Damon and Phillida.''  By the 1840s, [[P.T. Barnum]] was operating an entertainment complex in lower Manhattan (theatre in New York moved from downtown gradually to midtown beginning around 1850, seeking less expensive real estate prices, and did not arrive in the Times Square area until the 1920s and 1930s).  Broadway's first &quot;long-run&quot; musical was a 50 performance hit called ''The Elves'' in 1857.  New York runs continued to lag far behind those in London, but Laura Keene's &quot;musical burletta&quot; ''Seven Sisters'' (1860) shattered previous New York records with a run of 253 performances.

=== Development of musical comedy ===
The first theatre piece that conforms to the modern conception of a musical, adding dance and original music that helped to tell the story, is generally considered to be ''[[The Black Crook]]'', which premiered in New York on [[September 12]], [[1866]].  The production was a staggering five-and-a-half hours long, but despite its length, it ran for a record-breaking 474 performances.  The same year, ''The Black Domino/Between You, Me and the Post'' was the first show to call itself a &quot;musical comedy.&quot;&lt;ref name=Morley/&gt;  At that time, in England, musical theatre consisted of mostly of [[music hall]], adaptations of risque French operetta and burlesques, notably at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] beginning in 1868.  In reaction to these a few family-friendly entertainments were created, such as the [[German Reed Entertainments]].

Comedians [[Edward Harrigan]] and Tony Hart produced and starred in musicals on Broadway between 1878 (''The Mulligan Guard Picnic'') and 1885, with book and lyrics by Harrigan and music by his father-in-law David Braham.  These musical comedies featured characters and situations taken from the everyday life of New York's lower classes and represented a significant step forward from vaudeville and burlesque, towards a more literate form.  They starred high quality singers ([[Lillian Russell]], [[Vivienne Segal]], and [[Fay Templeton]]) instead of the ladies of questionable repute who had starred in earlier musical forms.

[[Image:Circa-1879-DOyly-Carte-HMS-Pinafore-from-Library-of-Congress2.jpg|thumb|left|Poster for an early production.|175px]]The length of runs in the theatre changed rapidly around the same time that the modern musical was born.  As transportation improved, poverty in London and New York diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, the number of potential patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously.  Plays could run longer and still draw in the audiences, leading to better profits and improved production values.  The first play to achieve 500 consecutive performances was the London (non-musical) comedy ''[[Our Boys]]'', opening in 1875, which set an astonishing new record of 1,362 performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-longr.html Article on long-running musicals before 1920]&lt;/ref&gt;

This run was not equalled on the musical stage until [[World War I]], but musical theatre soon broke the 500 performance mark London, most notably by the series of long-running [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] family-friendly [[comic opera]] hits, beginning with ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' in 1878,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Chimes of Normandy]]'', 1878 (adapted from the French ''Les Cloches de Corneville''), ran for 705 performances in London, beating any of the Gilbert and Sullivan pieces.  Its run was not exceeded by any other piece of musical theatre until ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'' broke its record in 1886&lt;/ref&gt; whose runs were exceeded by [[Alfred Cellier]] and [[B. C. Stephenson]]'s record-breaking 1886 hit, ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'' (a show midway between comic opera and musical comedy), with 931 performances, which was chased (but not equalled) by several of the most successful London musicals of the 1890s.  The most popular of these shows also enjoyed profitable New York productions and tours of Britain, America, Europe, Australasia and South Africa.  These shows were fare for &quot;respectable&quot; audiences and starred [[Gaiety Girls|respectable girls]], a marked contrast from the risqué burlesques, melodramas, bawdy music hall shows and badly translated French operettas that dominated the stage earlier in the 19th century and drew a sometimes seedy crowd looking for easy entertainment.

[[Charles Hoyt]]'s ''[[A Trip to Chinatown]]'' (1891) was Broadway's long-run champion (until ''[[Irene (musical)|Irene]]'' in 1919), running for 657 performances.  [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s comic operas were both pirated and imitated in New York by productions such as Reginald DeKoven's ''Robin Hood'' (1891) and [[John Philip Sousa]]'s ''[[El Capitan]]'' (1896).  ''A Trip to Coontown'' (1898) was the first musical comedy entirely produced and performed by [[African American]]s in a Broadway theatre (largely inspired by the routines of the [[minstrel show]]s), followed by the [[ragtime]]-tinged ''Clorindy the Origin of the Cakewalk'' (1898), and the highly successful ''In Dahomey'' (1902).  Hundreds of musical comedies were staged on Broadway in the 1890s and early 1900s comprised of songs written in New York's [[Tin Pan Alley]] involving composers such as [[Gus Edwards (songwriter)|Gus Edwards]], [[John J. McNally]], [[John Walter Bratton]], and [[George M. Cohan]] (''[[Little Johnny Jones]]'' (1904), ''45 Minutes From Broadway'' (1906), and ''George Washington Jr.'' (1906)).  Still, New York runs continued to be relatively short, with a few exceptions, compared with London runs, until [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgillan.screaming.net/stage/th-longr.html Article on long-running musicals before 1920]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GeorgeEdwardes.jpg|right|thumb|180px|George Edwardes]]Meanwhile, musicals had spread to the London stage by the [[Gay Nineties]].  [[George Edwardes]] had left the management of [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]'s [[Savoy Theatre]], perceiving that theatregoers' tastes had turned away from [[Savoy opera|Savoy]]-style comic operas and their intellectual, political, absurdist satire.  They wanted breezy music, snappy, romantic banter, and stylish spectacle.  He revolutionized the London stage by presenting musical comedies at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], [[Daly's Theatre]] and other venues that delivered these elements, borrowing others from Harrigan and Hart and adding in his famous [[Gaiety Girls]] to complete the musical and visual fun.  The success of first of these, ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' in 1892 and ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' in 1893 (which played at other theatres), confirmed Edwardes on the path he was taking.

[[Image:Cover of the Vocal Score of Sidney Jones' The Geisha.jpg|200px|left]]His early Gaiety hits included a series of light, romantic &quot;poor maiden loves aristocrat and wins him against all odds&quot; shows, usually with the word &quot;Girl&quot; in the title, including ''[[The Shop Girl]]'' (1894) and ''[[A Runaway Girl]]'' (1898), with music by [[Ivan Caryll]] and [[Lionel Monckton]].  These shows were immediately widely copied at other London theatres (and soon in America), and the [[Edwardian musical comedy]] swept away the earlier musical forms of comic opera and operetta.  At [[Daly's Theatre]], Edwardes presented slightly more complex comedy hits.  ''[[The Geisha]]'' (1896) by [[Sidney Jones]] with lyrics by [[Harry Greenbank]] and [[Adrian Ross]] and then Jones' ''[[San Toy]]'' (1899) each ran for more than two years and also finding great international success.  Other British musical comedy composers of the period included [[F. Osmond Carr]] and [[Edward Solomon]].

The British musical comedy ''[[Florodora]]'' (1899) by [[Leslie Stuart]] and [[Paul Rubens (composer)|Paul Rubens]] made a splash on both sides of the Atlantic, as did ''[[A Chinese Honeymoon]]'' (1901), by British lyricist [[George Dance (dramatist)|George Dance]] and American-born composer [[Howard Talbot]], which ran for a record setting 1,074 performances in London and 376 in New York.  The story concerns couples who honeymoon in China and inadvertently break the kissing laws (shades of ''[[The Mikado]]'').  ''[[The Belle of New York (theatre)|The Belle of New York]]'' (1898) ran for 697 performances in London after a brief New York run, becoming the first American musical to run for over a year in London.  After the turn of the century, [[Seymour Hicks]] (who joined forces with American producer [[Charles Frohman]]) wrote popular shows with composer [[Charles H. Taylor (lyricist)|Charles Taylor]] and others, and Edwardes and Ross continued to churn out hits like ''[[The Toreador]]'' (1901), ''[[A Country Girl]]'', ''[[The Orchid]]'' (1903), ''[[The Girls of Gottenberg]]'' (1907), ''[[Our Miss Gibbs]]'' (1909), and ''[[The Boy (musical)|The Boy]]'' (1917).  However, only three decades after Gilbert and Sullivan broke the stranglehold that French operettas had on the London stage, European operettas came roaring back to Britain and America beginning in 1907 with the London hit production of ''[[The Merry Widow]]''.

=== Operetta and World War I ===
Probably the best known composers of operetta, beginning in the second half of the 19th century, were [[Jacques Offenbach]] and [[Johann Strauss II]] (usually played in bad, bawdy translations in London and New York). In England, [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]] created an English answer to French operetta, styled British [[comic opera]], that became family-friendly hits in Britain and the U.S. in the 1870s and '80s.  Although British and American musicals of the 1890s and the first few years of the 20th century had virtually swept operetta and comic opera from the stage, operettas returned to the London and Broadway stages in 1907, and operettas and musicals became direct competitors for a while.  The winner of this competition was the theatre going public, who needed escapist entertainment during the dark times of [[World War I]] and flocked to theatres for musicals like ''[[Maid of the Mountains]]'', ''[[Irene (musical)|Irene]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Irene'' 's run of 670 performances was a Broadway record that held until 1938's ''[[Hellzapoppin]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the astonishing hit ''[[Chu Chin Chow]]'' (whose run of 2,238 performances, more than twice as many as any previous musical, set a record that stood for nearly forty years until ''[[Salad Days]]'') as well as popular revues like ''[[The Bing Boys Are Here]]''.

[[Image:Victor herbert.jpg|thumb|right|Victor Herbert|175px]]In the early years of the 20th century, translations of 19th century continental operettas, as well as operettas by a new generation of European composers, such as [[Franz Lehár]] and [[Oscar Straus (composer)|Oscar Straus]], among others, spread throughout the English-speaking world.  They were joined by British and American operetta composers and librettists of the 1910s (the &quot;Princess Theatre&quot; shows) by [[P. G. Wodehouse]], [[Guy Bolton]] and [[Harry B. Smith]], who paved the way for [[Jerome Kern]]'s later work by showing that a musical could combine a light popular touch with real continuity between story and musical numbers, and [[Victor Herbert]], whose work included some intimate musical plays with modern settings as well as his string of famous operettas (''[[The Fortune Teller (operetta)|The Fortune Teller]]'' (1898), ''[[Babes in Toyland (operetta)|Babes in Toyland]]'' (1903), ''[[Mlle. Modiste]]'' (1905), ''[[The Red Mill]]'' (1906), and ''[[Naughty Marietta (operetta)|Naughty Marietta]]'' (1910)).  These owed much to [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and the composers of the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.earthlink.net/~nmidkiff/dorothyarticles.html Midkoff, Neil article]&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of these operetta composers continued to serve as an inspiration to the next generation of composers of operettas and musicals in the 1920s and 1930s, such as [[Rudolf Friml]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[Sigmund Romberg]], [[George Gershwin]], and [[Noel Coward]], and these, in turn, influenced the Rodgers, Sondheim, and many others later in the century.&lt;ref name=Kenrick/&gt;  At the same time, [[George M. Cohan]] kept the theatres filled with lively musical entertainments, as the [[Shubert Brothers]] began to take control of the Broadway theatres.

=== The ''Roaring Twenties'' ===
The motion picture mounted a challenge to the stage.  At first, films were silent and presented only a limited challenge to theatre.  But by the end of the 1920s, films like ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'' could be presented with synchronized sound, and critics wondered if the cinema would replace live theatre altogether.  The musicals of the [[Roaring Twenties]], borrowing from [[vaudeville]], [[music hall]] and other light entertainments, tended to ignore plot in favor of emphasizing star actors and actresses, big dance routines, and popular songs.  Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, popular music was dominated by theatre writers.  Many shows were revues with little plot.  For instance, [[Florenz Ziegfeld]] produced annual spectacular song-and-dance revues on Broadway featuring extravagant sets and elaborate costumes, but there was little to tie the various numbers together.  In London, the ''Aldwych Farces'' were similarly successful, and stars such as [[Ivor Novello]] were popular.  These spectacles also raised production values, and mounting a musical generally became more expensive.

[[Image:Sallysm.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Sheet music from ''[[Sally (musical)|Sally]]'', 1920]]Typical of the decade were lighthearted productions like ''[[Sally (musical)|Sally]]''; ''[[Lady Be Good (musical)|Lady Be Good]]''; ''[[Sunny]]''; ''[[No, No, Nanette]]''; ''[[Oh, Kay!]]''; and ''[[Funny Face (musical)|Funny Face]]''.  Their books may have been forgettable, but they produced enduring standards from [[George Gershwin]], [[Cole Porter]], [[Jerome Kern]], [[Vincent Youmans]], and [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]], among others, and stars like [[Marilyn Miller]] and [[Fred Astaire]].  Audiences tapped their toes to these musicals on both sides of the Atlantic ocean while continuing to patronize the popular operettas that were continuing to come out of continental Europe and also from composers like [[Noel Coward]] in London and [[Sigmund Romberg]] and [[Rudolf Friml]] in America.  Clearly, cinema had not killed live theatre.

Leaving these comparatively frivolous entertainments behind, and taking the drama a giant step beyond Victor Herbert and sentimental operetta, ''[[Show Boat]]'', which premiered on [[December 27]], [[1927]] at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre]] in New York, represented a complete integration of book and score, with dramatic themes, as told through the music, dialogue, setting and movement, woven together more seamlessly than in previous musicals.  ''Show Boat'', with a book and lyrics adapted from [[Edna Ferber]]'s novel by [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]], and music by [[Jerome Kern]], presented a new concept that was embraced by audiences immediately.  Despite some of its startling themes—[[miscegenation]] among them—the original production ran a total of 572 (or 575, depending on the source) performances.  Still, Broadway runs lagged behind London's in general.  By way of comparison, in 1920, ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' began an astonishing run of 1,463 performances at the Lyric Theatre in [[Hammersmith]], England.

=== 1930s ===
[[Image:EthelMermanStageDoorCanteen.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ethel Merman]]]]
The [[Great Depression]] affected theatre audiences on both sides of the Atlantic, as people had little money to spend on entertainment.  In addition, &quot;talkie&quot; films at low prices presented a strong challenge to theatre of all kinds.  Only a few shows exceeded a run on Broadway or in London of 500 performances.  Still, for those who could afford it, this was an exciting time in the development of musical theatre.  Encouraged by the success of ''Show Boat'', creative teams began following the &quot;format&quot; of that popular hit.  ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'' (1931), a political satire with music by George Gershwin and lyrics by [[Ira Gershwin]] and [[Morrie Ryskind]], was the first musical to be awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]].  ''[[The Band Wagon]]'' (1931), starred dancing partners Fred Astaire and his sister Adele.  Porter's ''[[Anything Goes]]'' (1934) affirmed [[Ethel Merman]]'s position as the First Lady of musical theatre&amp;nbsp;– a title she maintained for many years.  ''[[As Thousands Cheer]]'' (1933) was an [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Moss Hart]] success that marked [[Marilyn Miller]]'s last show and the first Broadway show to star an African-American, [[Ethel Waters]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkinbroadway.com/regional/sanfran/s75.html Information about ''As Thousands Cheer'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (1935) was a step closer to [[opera]] than ''Show Boat'' and the other musicals of the era, and in some respects it foreshadowed such &quot;operatic&quot; musicals as ''[[West Side Story]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]''.  ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]'' (1937), with a book and score by [[Marc Blitzstein]] and directed by [[Orson Welles]], was a highly political piece that, despite the controversy surrounding it, managed to run for 108 performances.  [[Kurt Weill]]'s ''[[Knickerbocker Holiday]]'' brought to the musical stage New York City's early history, using as its source writings by [[Washington Irving]], while good-naturedly satirizing the good intentions of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

[[Image:Rodgers and Hart NYWTS.jpg|left|thumb|[[Rodgers and Hart]]]]
British writers such as Noel Coward and Ivor Novello continued to deliver old fashioned, sentimential musicals, such as ''[[The Dancing Years]]''.  Similarly, [[Rodgers &amp; Hart]] returned from Hollywood to churn out a series of lighthearted Broadway hits, including ''[[On Your Toes]]'' (1936, with [[Ray Bolger]], the first Broadway musical to make dramatic use of classical dance), ''[[Babes In Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[I'd Rather Be Right]]'', a political satire with [[George M. Cohan]] as President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and ''[[The Boys From Syracuse]]'' (1938), and [[Cole Porter]] wrote a similar string of hits, including ''[[Anything Goes]]'' (1934) and ''[[DuBarry Was a Lady]]'' (1939).  He later would go on to write scores for such classics as ''[[Can-Can (musical)|Can-Can]]'' (1953) and ''[[Silk Stockings]]'' (1955).  But the longest running piece of musical theatre of the 1930s was ''[[Hellzapoppin' (musical)|Hellzapoppin]]'' (1938), a revue with audience participation, which played for 1,404 performances, setting a new Broadway record that was finally beaten by ''[[Oklahoma!]]''

Despite the economic woes and the competition from film, the musical survived.  In fact, the move towards political satire in ''Of Thee I Sing'', ''I'd Rather Be Right'' and ''Knickerbocker Holiday'', together with the musical sophistication of the Gershwin, Kern, Rodgers and Weill musicals and the fast-paced staging and naturalistic dialogue style created by director [[George Abbott]] showed that musical theatre was finally evolving beyond the gags and showgirls musicals of the ''Gay Nineties'' and ''Roaring Twenties'' and the sentimental romance of operetta.

===''The Golden Age'' (1943 to 1968)===
[[Image:Rodgers and Hammerstein and Berlin and Tamiris NYWTS.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] (left and right) and [[Irving Berlin]] (center)]]
The Golden Age of the Broadway musical is generally considered to have begun with ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943) and to have ended with ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' (1968).

==== 1940s ====
The 1940s would begin with more hits from Porter, [[Irving Berlin]], Rodgers and Hart, Weill and Gershwin, some with runs over 500 performances as the economy rebounded, but artistic change was in the air.

[[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''Oklahoma!'' had a cohesive plot, songs that furthered the action of the story, and featured dream ballets which advanced the plot and developed the characters, rather than using dance as an excuse to parade scantily-clad women across the stage.  Rodgers and Hammerstein hired ballet choreographer [[Agnes de Mille]], who used everyday motions to help the characters express their ideas.  It defied musical conventions by raising its first act curtain not on a bevy of chorus girls, but rather on a woman churning butter, with an off-stage voice singing the opening lines of ''[[Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin']]''. It was the first &quot;blockbuster&quot; Broadway show, running a total of 2,212 performances, and was made into a hit film.  It remains one of the most frequently produced of the team's projects.  The two collaborators created an extraordinary collection of some of musical theatre's best loved and most enduring classics, including ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' (1945), ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' (1949), ''[[The King and I]]'' (1951), and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' (1959).  Some of these musicals, including ''Oklahoma!'', ''Carousel'', ''South Pacific'' and ''The  King and I'', treat more serious subject matter than most earlier shows: the villain in ''Oklahoma!'' is a suspected murderer and psychopath with a fondness for lewd post cards; ''Carousel'' deals with spousal abuse, thievery, suicide and the afterlife; ''South Pacific'' explores miscegenation even more thoroughly than ''Show Boat''; and the hero of ''The King and I'' dies onstage.

Americana was displayed on Broadway during the &quot;Golden Age&quot;, as the wartime cycle of shows began to arrive. An example of this is ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]'' (1944), written by [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]], composed by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and choreographed by [[Jerome Robbins]]. The musical is set during wartime, where a group of three sailors are on a 24 hour shore leave in New York. During their day, they each meet a wonderful woman. The women in this show have a specific power to them, as if saying, &quot;Come here! I need a man!&quot; The show also gives the impression of a country with an uncertain future, as the sailors also have with their women before leaving.

''Oklahoma!'' inspired others to continue the trend.  [[Irving Berlin]] used sharpshooter [[Annie Oakley]]'s career as a basis for his ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' (1946, 1,147 performances); [[Burton Lane]], [[E. Y. Harburg]], and [[Fred Saidy]] combined political satire with Irish whimsy for their fantasy ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' (1947, 1,725 performances); and Cole Porter found inspiration in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Taming of the Shrew]]'' for ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' (1948, 1,077 performances).  The American musicals overwhelmed the old-fashioned British Coward/Novello-style shows, one of the last big successes of which was Novello's ''[[Perchance to Dream (musical)|Perchance to Dream]]'' (1945, 1,021 performances).

==== 1950s ====
[[Image:JulieAndrews face.jpg|right|thumb|[[Julie Andrews]]]]
[[Damon Runyon]]'s eclectic characters were at the core of [[Frank Loesser]]'s and [[Abe Burrows]]' ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', (1950, 1,200 performances); and the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] was the setting for [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and [[Frederick Loewe]]'s ''[[Paint Your Wagon]]'' (1951).  The relatively brief run—289 performances—of that show didn't discourage [[Lerner and Loewe]] from collaborating again, this time on ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1956), an adaptation of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' starring [[Rex Harrison]] and [[Julie Andrews]], which at 2,717 performances held the long-run record for many years.  Popular Hollywood movies were made of all of these musicals. ''[[The Boy Friend]]'' (1954) ran for 2,078 performances in London, briefly becoming the third-longest running musical in West End or Broadway history (after ''Chu Chin Chow'' and ''Oklahoma!''), until it was demoted by ''Salad Days''.  It marked [[Julie Andrews]]' American debut.  Another record was set by ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', which ran for 2,707 performances, becoming the longest-running off-Broadway musical until ''The Fantasticks''.

As in ''Oklahoma!'', dance was an integral part of ''[[West Side Story]]'' (1957), which transported ''Romeo and Juliet'' to modern day New York City and converted the feuding Montague and Capulet families into opposing ethnic gangs, the Jets and the Sharks.  The book was adapted by [[Arthur Laurents]], with music by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and lyrics by newcomer [[Stephen Sondheim]].  It was embraced by the critics but failed to be a popular choice for the &quot;blue-haired matinee ladies,&quot; who preferred the small town River City, Iowa of [[Meredith Willson]]'s ''[[The Music Man]]'' to the alleys of [[Manhattan]]'s Upper West Side. Apparently [[Tony Award]] voters were of a similar mind, since they favored the former over the latter.  ''West Side Story'' had a respectable run of 732 performances (1,040 in the West End), while ''The Music Man'' ran nearly twice as long, with 1,375 performances.  However, the film of ''West Side Story'' was extremely successful.

Laurents and Sondheim teamed up again for ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]'' (1959, 702 performances), with [[Jule Styne]] providing the music for a backstage story about the most driven stage mother of all-time, stripper [[Gypsy Rose Lee]]'s mother Rose.  The original production ran for 702 performances, and was given four subsequent revivals, with [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Tyne Daly]], [[Bernadette Peters]] and [[Patti LuPone]] later tackling the role made famous by Ethel Merman.

Automotive companies and other types of corporations began to hire Broadway talent to write [[industrial musical|corporate musicals]], private shows which were only seen by their employees or customers.  The 1950s ended with [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s last hit, ''The Sound of Music'', which also became another hit for Mary Martin.  It ran for 1,443 performances and shared the Tony Award for Best Musical.  Together with its extremely successful [[The Sound of Music (film)|1965 film version]], it has become one of the most popular musicals in history.

==== 1960s ====
In 1960, ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' was first produced off-Broadway.  This intimate allegorical show would quietly run for over 40 years at the Sullivan Street Theatre in [[Greenwich Village]], becoming by far the longest-running musical in history.  Its authors produced other innovative works in the 1960s, such as ''[[Celebration (musical)|Celebration]]'' and ''[[I Do! I Do!]]'', the first two-character Broadway musical.  The 1960s would see a number of  blockbusters, like ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' (1964; 3,242 performances), ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1964; 2,844 performances), ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]'' (1964; 1,348 performances), and ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' (1965; 2,328 performances), and some more risqué pieces like ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', before ending with the emergence of the [[rock musical]].  Two men had considerable impact on musical theatre history beginning in this decade, Stephen Sondheim and [[Jerry Herman]].

The first project for which Sondheim wrote both music and lyrics was ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (1962, 964 performances), with a book based on the works of [[Plautus]] by [[Burt Shevelove]] and [[Larry Gelbart]], and starring [[Zero Mostel]]. Sondheim moved the musical beyond its concentration on the romantic plots typical of earlier eras; his work tended to be darker, exploring the grittier sides of life both present and past.  Some of his earlier works include ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]'' (1964, which—at a mere nine performances, despite having star power in [[Lee Remick]] and [[Angela Lansbury]]—is an infamous flop), ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' (1970), ''[[Follies]]'' (1971), and ''[[A Little Night Music]]'' (1973). He has found inspiration in the unlikeliest of sources—the opening of [[Japan]] to Western trade for ''[[Pacific Overtures]]'', a legendary murderous barber seeking revenge in the [[Industrial Age]] of London for ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'', the paintings of [[Georges Seurat]] for ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'', fairy tales for ''[[Into the Woods]]'', and a collection of individuals intent on eliminating the [[President of the United States]] in ''[[Assassins (musical)|Assassins]]''.

While some critics have argued that some of Sondheim’s musicals are less popular with the public because of their unusual lyrical sophistication and musical complexity, others have praised these features of his work, as well as the interplay of lyrics and music in his shows. Some of Sondheim's notable innovations include a show presented in reverse (''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'') and the above-mentioned ''Anyone Can Whistle'', in which Act 1 ends with the cast informing the audience that they are mad.

Jerry Herman played a significant role in American musical theatre, beginning with his first Broadway production, ''[[Milk and Honey (musical)|Milk and Honey]]'' (1961, 563 performances), about the founding of the state of [[Israel]], and continuing with the smash hits ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1964, 2,844 performances), ''[[Mame]]'' (1966, 1,508 performances), and ''[[La Cage aux Folles]]'' (1983, 1,761 performances). Even his less successful shows like ''[[Dear World]]'' (1969) and ''[[Mack &amp; Mabel]]'' (1974) have had memorable scores (''[[Mack &amp; Mabel]]'' was later reworked into a London hit).  Writing both words and music, many of Herman's showtunes have become popular standards, including &quot;[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello, Dolly!]]&quot;, &quot;We Need a Little Christmas&quot;, &quot;I Am What I Am&quot;, &quot;Mame&quot;, &quot;The Best of Times&quot;, &quot;Before the Parade Passes By&quot;, &quot;Put On Your Sunday Clothes&quot;, &quot;It Only Takes a Moment&quot;, &quot;Bosom Buddies&quot;, and &quot;I Won't Send Roses&quot;, recorded by such artists as [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Eydie Gorme]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Petula Clark]] and [[Bernadette Peters]].  Herman's songbook has been the subject of two popular musical revues, ''[[Jerry's Girls]]'' (Broadway, 1985), and ''[[Showtune]]'' (off-Broadway, 2003).

The musical started to diverge from the relatively narrow confines of the 1950s.  [[Rock music]] would be used in several Broadway musicals, beginning with ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', which featured not only rock music but also nudity and controversial opinions about the [[Vietnam War]].

==== Social themes ====
After ''[[Show Boat]]'' and ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', and as the struggle in America and elsewhere for minorities' [[civil rights]] progressed, Hammerstein, [[Harold Arlen]], [[Yip Harburg]] and others were emboldened to write more musicals and operas which aimed to normalize societal toleration of minorities and urged racial harmony.  Early Golden Age works that focused on racial tolerance included ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', and the ''[[The King and I]]''. Towards the end of the Golden Age, several shows tackled Jewish subjects and issues, such as ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', ''[[Milk and Honey (musical)|Milk and Honey]]'', ''[[Blitz!]]'' and later ''[[Rags (musical)|Rags]]''.  The original concept that became ''[[West Side Story]]'' was set in the [[Lower East Side]] during Easter-Passover celebrations; the rival gangs were to be Jewish and [[Italian-American|Italian]] [[Catholic]].  The creative team later decided that the Polish (white) vs. [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] conflict was fresher.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Laurents, [http://www.leonardbernstein.com/studio/element.asp?FeatID=8&amp;AssetID=18 Theatre: West Side Story; The Growth of an Idea], ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', August 4, 1957. Reproduced on leonardbernstein.com. Accessed 12 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolerance as an important theme in musicals has continued in recent decades.  The final expression of ''West Side Story'' left a message of racial tolerance.  By the end of the '60s, musicals became racially integrated, with black and white cast members even covering each others' roles, as they did in ''Hair''.  Casting in some musicals is an attempt to represent the community at the subject of the drama, as in ''Rent'' and ''[[In the Heights]]''.  Homosexuality has been explored in such musicals, beginning with ''Hair'', and even more overtly in ''[[La Cage aux Folles]]'' and ''[[Falsettos]]''.  ''[[Parade (musical)|Parade]]'' is a sensitive exploration of both [[anti-Semitism]] and historical American [[racism]].

=== More recent eras ===
==== 1970s ====
After the success of ''Hair'', [[rock musical]]s flourished in the 1970s, with ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', ''[[Godspell]]'', ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' and ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona (musical)|Two Gentlemen of Verona]]''.  Some of these rock musicals began with &quot;[[concept album]]s&quot; and then moved to film or stage, such as ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]''.  Others had no dialogue or were otherwise reminiscent of opera, with dramatic, emotional themes; these sometimes started as [[concept albums]] and were referred to as [[rock opera]]s.  The musical also went in other directions.  Shows like ''[[Raisin (musical)|Raisin]]'', ''[[Dreamgirls]]'', ''[[Purlie]]'', and ''[[The Wiz]]'' brought a significant African-American influence to Broadway.  More varied musical genres and styles were incorporated into musicals both on and especially [[off-Broadway]].

1975 brought one of the great contemporary musicals to the stage. ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' emerged from recorded group therapy-style sessions [[Michael Bennett]] conducted with Gypsies&amp;nbsp;— those who sing and dance in support of the leading players&amp;nbsp;—from the Broadway community.  From hundreds of hours of tapes, [[James Kirkwood, Jr.]] and [[Nick Dante]] fashioned a book about an audition for a musical, incorporating into it many of the real-life stories of those who had sat in on the sessions&amp;nbsp;— and some of whom eventually played variations of themselves or each other in the show. With music by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] and lyrics by [[Edward Kleban]], ''A Chorus Line'' first opened at [[Joseph Papp]]'s [[Public Theater]] in lower [[Manhattan]].  Advance word-of-mouth— that something extraordinary was about to explode&amp;nbsp;— boosted box office sales, and after critics ran out of superlatives to describe what they witnessed on opening night, what initially had been planned as a limited engagement eventually moved to the [[Shubert Theatre]] uptown for a run that seemed to last forever.  The show swept the Tony Awards and won the [[Pulitzer Prize]], and its hit song, ''What I Did for Love'', became an instant standard.

Clearly, Broadway audiences were eager to welcome musicals that strayed from the usual style and substance. [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] explored pre-[[World War II]] [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Germany]] in ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' and [[Prohibition]]-era ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'', which relied on old [[vaudeville]] techniques to tell its tale of murder and the media. ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'', by [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], was set in the days of [[Charlemagne]]. [[Federico Fellini]]'s autobiographical film ''[[8½]]'' became [[Maury Yeston]]'s ''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]''.  At the end of the decade, ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' gave a more serious political biography than audiences were used to at musicals, and ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'' was the precursor to the darker, big budget musicals of the 1980s like ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'', ''[[Miss Saigon]]'', and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', that depended on dramatic stories, sweeping scores and spectacular effects.  But during this same period, old-fashioned values were still embraced in such hits as ''[[Annie]]'', ''[[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]]'', ''[[My One and Only]]'', and popular revivals of ''No, No, Nanette'' and ''[[Irene (musical)|Irene]]''.

==== 1980s and 1990s ====
[[Image:Elaine Paige Annie Skates.jpg|thumb|200px|Elaine Paige.]]
The 1980s and 1990s saw the influence of European &quot;mega-musicals&quot; or &quot;pop operas,&quot; which typically featured a pop-influenced score and had large casts and sets and were identified as much by their notable effects—a falling [[chandelier]] (in ''Phantom''), a helicopter landing on stage (in ''[[Miss Saigon]]'')—as they were by anything else in the production. Many were based on novels or other works of literature.  The most important writers of mega-musicals include the French team of [[Claude-Michel Schönberg]] and [[Alain Boublil]], responsible for ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'', which became the longest-running international musical hit in history. The team, in collaboration with [[Richard Maltby, Jr.]], continued to produce hits with ''Miss Saigon'' (inspired by the Puccini opera ''[[Madame Butterfly]]'').  The British composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], saw similar mega-success with ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'', based on the life of [[Argentina]]'s [[Eva Perón]], and ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', derived from the poems of [[T. S. Eliot]], both of which musicals originally starred [[Elaine Paige]], who with continued success has become known as the First Lady of British Musical Theatre. Other Lloyd Webber musical successes include ''[[Starlight Express]]'', famous for being performed on rollerskates; ''The Phantom of the Opera'', derived from the novel &quot;Le Fantôme de l'Opéra&quot; written by [[Gaston Leroux]]; and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (from the classic film of the same name).  Several of these mega-musicals ran (or are still running) for decades in both New York and London.  The 90s also saw the influence of large corporations on the production of musicals. The most important has been [[The Walt Disney Company]], which began adapting some of its animated movie musicals—such as ''[[Beauty and the Beast (theatrical production)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]''—for the stage, and also created original stage productions like ''[[Aida]]'', with music by [[Elton John]].  Disney continues to create new musicals for Broadway and West End theatres, such as, ''[[Tarzan (musical)|Tarzan]]'', a stage adaptation of the classic ''[[Mary Poppins (musical)|Mary Poppins]]'', and, most recently, a stage version of 1989's ''[[The Little Mermaid (musical)|The Little Mermaid]]''.

[[Image:558.jpg|thumb|left|An example of the trend: a small-scale musical that became highly successful.]]
With the growing scale (and cost) of musicals, style was sometimes emphasized in favor of substance during the last two decades of the 20th century.  At the same time, however, many writers broke from this pattern and began to create smaller scale, but critically-acclaimed and financially successful musicals, such as ''[[Falsettoland]]'', ''[[Passion (musical)|Passion]]'', ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', ''[[Bat Boy: The Musical]]'', and ''[[Blood Brothers (musical)|Blood Brothers]]''.  The topics vary widely, and the music ranges from rock to pop, but they often are produced off-Broadway (or for smaller London theatres) and feature smaller casts and generally less expensive productions.  Some of these have been noted as imaginative and innovative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwaybaby.com/edinburgh/fringe/reviews/batboy BroadwayBaby site article on ''Bat Boy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of tickets to Broadway and West End musicals was escalating beyond the budget of many theatregoers, and the trend was for these musicals to be viewed by a smaller and smaller audience.  [[Jonathan Larson]]'s musical ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (based on the opera ''[[La Bohème]]'') attempted to increase the popularity of musicals among a younger audience.  It features a cast of [[twentysomething]]s, and the score is heavily rock-influenced.  The musical became a hit, even with its composer dying of an [[aortic aneurysm]] on the night of the final dress rehearsal at [[New York Theatre Workshop]], before he could see it reach Broadway.  A group of young fans, styled [[Renthead|RENTheads]], line up at the [[Nederlander Theatre]] hours early in hopes of winning the lottery for $20 front row tickets, and some have seen the show more than 50 times.  Other writers who have attempted to bring a taste of modern rock music to the stage include [[Jason Robert Brown]].

Another trend has been to create a minimal plot to fit a collection of songs that have already been hits.  These have included ''[[Buddy - The Buddy Holly Story]]'' (1995), ''[[Movin' Out (musical)|Movin' Out]]'' (2002, based on the tunes of [[Billy Joel]]), ''[[Good Vibrations (musical)|Good Vibrations]]'' ([[the Beach Boys]]), ''[[All Shook Up (musical)|All Shook Up]]'' ([[Elvis Presley]]), ''[[Jersey Boys]]'' (2006, [[The Four Seasons (group)|The Four Seasons]]), ''[[Daddy Cool (musical)|Daddy Cool—The Boney M Musical]]'', and many others. This style is often referred to as the &quot;[[jukebox musical]]&quot;.  Similar but more plot-driven musicals have been built around the canon of a particular pop group including ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' (1999, featuring songs by [[ABBA]]), ''[[Our House (musical)|Our House]]'' (based on the songs of [[Madness (band)|Madness]]), and ''[[We Will Rock You (musical)|We Will Rock You]]'' (based on the works of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]).

==== 2000s ====
;Recent trends
In recent years, familiarity has been embraced by producers anxious to guarantee that they recoup their considerable investments, if not show a healthy profit.  Some are willing to take (usually modest-budget) chances on the new and unusual, such as ''[[Urinetown]]'' (2001), ''[[Bombay Dreams]]'' (2002; about the [[Bollywood]] musicals churned out by Indian cinema), ''[[Avenue Q]]'' (2003; utilizes puppets to tell its adult-themed story), and ''[[The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee]]'' (2005; people watching the show can become &quot;spellers&quot; in the show). But the majority prefer to hedge their bets by sticking with revivals of familiar fare like ''[[Wonderful Town]]'' or ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', or proven hits like ''[[La Cage aux Folles]]''.  Today's composers are finding their sources in already proven material, such as films (roughly one-third of current Broadway musicals, including ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'', ''[[Spamalot]]'', ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'', ''[[Legally Blonde (musical) |Legally Blonde]]'', ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical|Billy Elliot]]'', ''[[The Color Purple (musical)|The Color Purple]]'', and ''[[Grey Gardens (musical)|Grey Gardens]]'') or literature (such as ''[[Little Women]]'', ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'', ''[[Dracula]]'', and ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'') hoping that the shows will have a built-in audience as a result.  The reuse of plots, especially those from [[The Walt Disney Company]], has been considered by some critics to be a redefinition of Broadway: rather than a creative outlet, it has become a tourist attraction.&lt;ref name=Kenrick/&gt;

The musical is being pulled in a number of different directions.  It is less likely today that a sole producer—a [[David Merrick]] or a [[Cameron Mackintosh]]—backs a production.  Corporate sponsors dominate Broadway, and often alliances are formed to stage musicals which require an investment of $10 million or more. In 2002, the credits for ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]'' listed ten producers, and among those names were entities comprised of several individuals. Typically, off-Broadway and regional theatres tend to produce smaller and therefore less expensive musicals, and development of new musicals has increasingly taken place outside of New York and London or in smaller venues.  ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'' was developed off-Broadway before being launched on Broadway in 2006.

It also appears that the spectacle format is on the rise again, returning to the times when Romans would have mock sea battles on stage. This was true of ''[[Starlight Express]]'' and is most apparent in the musical adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (musical)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' that ran in [[Toronto]], Canada in 2006, and opened for previews in May 2007 at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London, billed as the biggest stage production in musical theatre history.  The expensive production lost money in Toronto.  Conversely, ''[[The Drowsy Chaperone]]'', ''[[The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee]]'', ''[[Xanadu (musical)|Xanadu]]'' and others are part of a Broadway trend to present musicals uninterrupted by an intermission, with short running time of less than two hours.  The latter two, together with works like ''[[Avenue Q]]'', also represent a trend towards presenting smaller-scale, small cast musicals that are able to show a good profit in a smaller house.

;Renaissance of the movie-musical and TV &quot;musicals&quot;
After [[Evita (film)|the 1996 film of ''Evita'']], the first successful movie musical in nearly two decades, [[Baz Luhrmann]] continued the revival of the movie musical with ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001).  This was followed by a number of film successes, including ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' in 2002, ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]'' in 2004, ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'' in 2006, and ''[[Hairspray (2007 film)|Hairspray]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]'' in 2007.  [[Dr. Seuss]]'s ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' (2000) and ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|The Cat in the Hat]]'' (2003), made the children's book into live-action musicals.  Disney and other animated musicals and more adult animated musical films, like ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]'' (1999), paved the way for the revival of the movie musical.  In addition, India is producing numerous &quot;Bollywood&quot; film musicals, and Japan is producing &quot;Anime&quot; film musicals.  Occasionally, &quot;made for TV&quot; movies, such as ''[[Gypsy:_A_Musical_Fable#Film_and_TV_versions|Gypsy]]'' (1993), and ''[[Cinderella (TV)|Cinderella]]'' (1997), are made in musical format.

Some recent television shows have set an episode as a musical as a play on their usual format (examples include episodes of ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer's]]'' episode ''[[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy episode)|Once More, with Feeling]]'', ''[[That's So Raven]]'', ''[[Daria|Daria's]]'' episode ''Daria!'', ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz's]]'' ''Variety'', ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'''s ''O Coast to Coast!/Boatshow'', ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' (in an episode written by the creators of ''Avenue Q''), and the 100th Episode of ''[[That '70s Show]]'') or have included scenes where characters suddenly begin singing and dancing in a musical-theatre style during an episode, such as in several episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[30 Rock]]'', ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', and ''[[Family Guy]]''.   The television series ''[[Cop Rock]]'', extensively used the musical format as does the series ''[[The Mighty Boosh]]''.

There have also been musicals made for the internet, including ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog|Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog,]]'' about a low-rent supervillain played by [[Neil Patrick Harris]]. It was written during the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|WGA writer's strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Exclusive: First Look at Joss Whedon's &quot;Dr. Horrible&quot; | author = Matt Roush | work = Roush Dispatch | publisher = [[TV Guide]] | date = 2008-06-30 | url = http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Roush-Dispatch/Joss-Whedon-Dr/800042425 | accessdate = 2006-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International musicals ===
The U.S. and Britain were the most active sources of book musicals from the 19th century through much of the 20th century (although Europe produced various forms of popular [[light opera]] and operetta, for example Spanish [[Zarzuela]], during that period and even earlier). However, the light musical stage in other countries has become more active in recent decades.

Musicals from other English speaking countries (notably Australia and Canada) often do well locally, and occasionally even reach Broadway or the West End (e.g., ''[[The Boy from Oz]]'' and ''[[The Drowsy Chaperone]]'').  [[South Africa]] has an active musical theatre scene, with revues like ''African Footprint'' and ''Umoja'' and book musicals, such as ''[[Kat and the Kings]]'' and [[Taliep Petersen]] and ''[[Sarafina!]]'' touring internationally.  Locally, musicals like ''Vere'', ''Love and Green Onions'', ''Over the Rainbow: the all-new all-gay... extravaganza'' and ''Bangbroek Mountain'' have been produced successfully.

Successful musicals from continental Europe include shows from (among other countries) Germany (''[[Elixier]]'' and ''[[Ludwig II (musical)|Ludwig II ]]''), Austria (''[[Dance of the Vampires]]'' and ''[[Elisabeth (musical)|Elisabeth]]''), Czech Republic (''[[Angelique (series)|Angelika]]''), France (''[[Notre Dame de Paris (musical)|Notre Dame de Paris]]'', ''Les Misérables'', ''[[Angelique (series)|Angélique, Marquise des Anges]]'' and ''[[Romeo &amp; Juliette]]'') and Spain (''[[Hoy No Me Puedo Levantar]]'').

Japan has recently seen the growth of an indigenous form of musical theatre, both animated and live action, mostly based on [[Anime]] and [[Manga]], such as ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'' and ''[[Tenimyu]]''.  The popular ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' metaseries has had twenty-nine [[Sailor Moon musicals]], spanning thirteen years. Beginning in 1914, a series of popular [[revue]]s have been performed by the all-female [[Takarazuka Revue]], which currently fields five performing troupes.  Elsewhere in Asia, the Indian [[Bollywood]] musical, mostly in the form of motion pictures, is tremendously successful.  [[Hong Kong]]'s first modern musical, produced in both [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] and [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], is ''[[Snow.Wolf.Lake]]''.

Other countries with an especially active musicals scene include [[the Netherlands]], Italy, Sweden, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Russia, Turkey and China.{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

=== Relevance ===
In the 2006-07 season, 12 million tickets were purchased on Broadway for a gross sale amount of almost a billion dollars{{Fact|date=May 2008}}.  The League of American Theatres and Producers announced that more than half of those tickets were purchased by tourists (5 million domestic and 1.3 million foreign).  This does not include off-Broadway and smaller venues.  These statistics were near historic records (including both plays and musicals).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livebroadway.com/index.php?url_identifier=press-releases&amp;news=the-league-of-american-theatres-and-producers-announces-2006-2007&amp;type=news Announcement of 2006-07 Broadway season]&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the Society of London Theatre reported that 2006 set a record for attendance, revenue and advance booking in London.  Total attendees in the major commercial and grant-aided theatres in Central London were 12.4 million, and total ticket revenues were just over £400 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solt.co.uk/site/media/documents/33441_2006boxoffice.pdf Press Release &quot;Records Tumble in Theatreland&quot;, Jan. 29, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, as noted above, the international musicals scene has been particularly active in recent years.

However, Stephen Sondheim has been less than optimistic:
:&quot;You have two kinds of shows on Broadway&amp;nbsp;– revivals and the same kind of musicals over and over again, all spectacles. You get your tickets for ''The Lion King'' a year in advance, and essentially a family... pass on to their children the idea that that's what the theater is&amp;nbsp;– a spectacular musical you see once a year, a stage version of a movie. It has nothing to do with theater at all. It has to do with seeing what is familiar.... I don't think the theatre will die per se, but it's never going to be what it was.... It's a tourist attraction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted by [[Frank Rich]] in ''Conversations with Sondheim'', [[New York Times Magazine]], March 12, 2000, pp. 40 and 88&lt;/ref&gt;

But the success of original material like ''Avenue Q'', ''Urinetown'', and ''Spelling Bee'', as well as creative re-imaginings of film properties, including ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'', ''Hairspray'', ''[[Billy Elliot]]'' and ''The Color Purple'', and plays-turned-musicals, such as ''[[Spring Awakening]]'' prompts Broadway historian John Kenrick to write: &quot;Is the Musical dead? ...Absolutely not! Changing? Always! The musical has been changing ever since [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] did his first rewrite in the 1850s. And change is the clearest sign that the musical is still a living, growing genre. Will we ever return to the so-called &quot;golden age,&quot; with musicals at the center of popular culture? Probably not. Public taste has undergone fundamental changes, and the commercial arts can only flow where the paying public allows.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kenrick/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Oprah's Book Club''' is a [[Book discussion club|book club]] segment of the [[United States|American]] [[talk show]] ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', highlighting books chosen by host [[Oprah Winfrey]]. Winfrey started the book club in 1996 by selecting a new book each month. Because of the book club's wide popularity, many obscure titles have become very popular [[bestsellers]], increasing sales by as many as a million copies at the height of the book club's popularity; this occurrence is known colloquially as the ''Oprah effect''.&lt;ref name=&quot;oprah effect&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Wyatt | first =Edward | coauthors = | title = Tolstoy's Translators Experience Oprah's Effect | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =''The New York Times'' | date =[[2004-06-07]] | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E6D81131F934A35755C0A9629C8B63 | accessdate =2007-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book club has also been connected to several well known literary controversies such as [[Jonathan Franzen]]'s public dissatisfaction with his novel ''[[The Corrections]]'' having been chosen by Winfrey, and the now infamous incident of [[James Frey]]'s memoir, ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'', a 2005 selection, being outed as largely fabricated.

==History==
The book club's first selection in September of 1996 was the recently published novel ''[[The Deep End of the Ocean]]'' by [[Jacquelyn Mitchard]].  Winfrey's choices averaged one new book a month for the next six years.  Winfrey discontinued the book club for one year in 2002, stating that she could not keep up with the required reading in order to find contemporary books that she enjoyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;turns page&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Lacayo | first =Richard | coauthors = | title =Oprah Turns the Page | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Time Magazine'' | date =[[2002-04-07]] | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002228,00.html | accessdate =2007-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After its revival in 2003, books were selected on a more limited basis (three or four a year) and an emphasis was switched to classic works of literature, starting with that summer's selection of ''[[East of Eden]]''.  Steinbeck's then fifty-one year old novel spent seven weeks at the top of the ''New York Times'' list of paperback best sellers.&lt;ref name=&quot;oprah effect&quot;/&gt;  In September of 2005, Winfrey announced she would be opening the book club up to a wide range of titles and genres, including non-fiction and [[memoir]].

==Influence==
In ''Reading with Oprah: The Book Club That Changed America'', [[Kathleen Rooney]] describes Winfrey as &quot;a serious American [[intellectual]] who pioneered the use of electronic media, specifically [[television]] and the [[Internet]], to take reading – a decidedly non-technological and highly individual act – and highlight its social elements and uses in such a way to motivate millions of erstwhile non-readers to pick up books.&quot;

[[Business Week]] stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of the Oprah phenomenon is how outsized her power is compared with that of other market movers. Some observers suggest that [[Jon Stewart]] of [[Comedy Central]]'s [[The Daily Show]] could be No. 2. Other proven arm-twisters include [[Fox News]]'s [[Sean Hannity]], [[National Public Radio]]'s [[Terry Gross]], [[radio]] personality [[Don Imus]], and [[CBS]]' [[60 Minutes]]. But no one comes close to Oprah's clout: Publishers estimate that her power to sell a book is anywhere from 20 to 100 times that of any other media personality.&lt;ref name=&quot;wallet&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Why Oprah Opens Readers' Wallets  | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =''Business Week'' | date =[[2005-10-10]] | url =http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_41/b3954059.htm | accessdate =2007-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Controversies==
Many literature critics have criticized Winfrey's book selections as overly sentimental. The most notable of these criticisms came from [[Jonathan Franzen]], whose book ''[[The Corrections]]'' was selected in 2001. After the announcement was made, he expressed distaste with being in the company of other Oprah's Book Club authors, saying in an interview that Winfrey had &quot;picked some good books, but she's picked enough schmaltzy, one-dimensional ones that I cringe, myself, even though I think she's really smart and she's really fighting the good fight.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;franzen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powells.com/authors/franzen.html%20Powells.com |title= Jonathan Franzen Uncorrected  |accessdate=2007-10-05 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oprah suspended the club for a year shortly after Franzen's criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;turns page&quot;/&gt;

In late 2005 and early 2006, Oprah's Book Club was again in the news. Winfrey selected [[James Frey]]'s ''[[A Million Little Pieces]]'' for the September 2005 selection. ''Pieces'' is a book billed as a [[memoir]] – a true account of Frey's life as an [[alcoholic]], [[drug addict]] and criminal. But critics soon questioned the validity of Frey's supposedly true account, especially regarding his treatment while in a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] facility and his stories of time spent in [[Prison|jail]]. Initially, Frey convinced [[Larry King]] that the embellishments in his book were part of any literary memoir and Winfrey encouraged debate about how creative non-fiction should be classified, and cited the inspirational impact Frey's work has had on so many of her viewers. But as more accusations against the book continued to surface, Winfrey invited Frey on the show, to find out directly from him whether he had lied to her and her viewers. During a heated live televised debate, Winfrey forced Frey to admit that he had indeed lied about spending time in jail, and that he had no idea whether he had two [[root canal]]s or not, despite devoting several pages to describing them. Winfrey then brought out Frey's publisher [[Nan Talese]] to defend her decision to classify the book as a memoir, and forced Talese to admit that she had done nothing to check the book's veracity, despite the fact that her representatives had assured Winfrey's staff that the book was indeed non-fiction and described it as &quot;brutally honest&quot; in a press release.

The media feasted over the televised showdown. [[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]] of the [[New York Times]] wrote: &quot;Both Mr. Frey and Ms. Talese were snapped in two like dry winter twigs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;truthiness&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Carr | first =David | coauthors = | title =How Oprahness Trumped Truthiness | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =''The New York Times'' | date =[[2006-01-30]] | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/business/media/30carr.html?ex=1296277200&amp;en=1c0e8843da5b43d6&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss | accessdate =2007-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York Times]] columnist [[Maureen Dowd]] quipped sarcastically, &quot;It was a huge relief, after our long national slide into untruth and no consequences, into Swift boating and swift bucks, into W.'s delusion and denial, to see the Empress of Empathy icily hold someone accountable for lying,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bunk&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Dowd | first =Maureen | coauthors = | title =Oprah's Bunk Club | work = | pages = | language = | publisher =''The New York Times'' | date =[[2006-01-08]] | url =http://homepage.mac.com/imfalse/chapel_annex/oprahs_bunk_club.html | accessdate =2007-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Washington Post]]'s [[Richard Cohen (journalist)|Richard Cohen]] was so impressed by the confrontation that he crowned Winfrey &quot;Mensch of the Year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Poniewozik  | first =James | coauthors = | title =Oprah Clarifies Her Position: Truth, Good.

The '''Vaganova Ballet Academy''' is probably the most famous and influential [[classical ballet]] school in the world.  It has also been known as the '''Imperial Ballet School''' and the '''Leningrad State Choreographic Institute'''.  There are other variations of the name, however ''Vaganova Ballet Academy'' is the official title used in English speaking countries.

Established in [[1738]], the academy is based in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]] and is named after the renowned pedagogue [[Agrippina Vaganova]], who cultivated the method of classical ballet training that has been taught at the school since the late 1920s.  Graduates of the school include some of the most famous ballet dancers, choreographers and teachers in history and many of the worlds leading ballet schools have adopted elements of the [[Vaganova method]] into their own training.

The ''Vaganova Ballet Academy'' is the associate school of the ''[[Mariinsky Ballet]]'', one of the Worlds leading ballet companies, although students of the school are successful in achieving employment with ballet and contemporary companies worldwide, such as the [[Bolshoi Ballet]], [[The Royal Ballet]] and [[American Ballet Theatre]].

==History==
The school was established as the ''Imperial Theatre School'' by decree of the [[Anna of Russia|Empress Anna]] on [[4 May]], [[1738]] with the French [[Ballet Master]] Jean-Baptiste Lande as its director. The first classes occupied empty rooms in the [[Winter Palace]] in [[St Petersburg]] and the first students were twelve boys and twelve girls.  The purpose of the school was to form Russia's first professional dance company, which lead to the formation of the ''Imperial Russian Ballet'', the school becoming known as the ''Imperial Ballet School''.  The ''Imperial Russian Ballet'' is the direct predecessor of today's ''[[Mariinsky Ballet| Mariinsky Ballet'', which remains one of the worlds leading ballet companies to this day, with the Vaganova Academy as its associate school.

Nearly all the early teachers at the school were from Western Europe, including Franz Hilferding and Giovanni Canzianni. The first Russian teacher to join the school was Ivan Valberg.  After the spread of ballet in Europe, the development of the school was influenced by a number of other teachers and methods, including Christian Johannson, a student of [[August Bournonville]], and the Italian methods of [[Enrico Cecchetti]], [[Pierina Legnani]] and Carlotta Brianza.  Other renowned 19th century dancers and ballet masters who taught at and were influential in the development in the school include [[Charles Didelot]], [[Jules Perrot]], [[Arthur Saint-Léon]], [[Lev Ivanov]], [[Marius Petipa]] and [[Mikhail Fokine]].

Since 1836 the school has been situated on Rossi Street in St Petersburg.  Following the upheaval of the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, St Petersburg was renamed [[Leningrad]] after the [[communist]] revolutionary [[Vladimir Lenin]].  The ''Imperial Ballet School'' was dissolved by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Government]] and later re-established on the same site, as the ''Leningrad State Choreographic School''.  The ''Imperial Russian Ballet'' was also dissolved as a result of the revolution and was re-established as the ''Soviet Ballet''.  The company was later renamed the ''[[Kirov Ballet]]'' following the assassination of the [[Bolshevic]] revolutionary [[Sergey Kirov]] in 1938.  Despite later being given the current name ''Mariinsky Ballet'', the company is still commonly known as the ''Kirov Ballet'' by the majority of Western audiences and the company still use the title ''Kirov Ballet'' when touring internationally.


==Vaganova==
{{main|Agrippina Vaganova}}
{{seealso|Vaganova method}}

Agrippina Vaganova brought perhaps the most important developments in modern Russian Ballet.  She graduated from the former ''Imperial Ballet School'' in 1897 and danced with the ''Imperial Ballet'', retiring from the stage early to pursue her teaching career following the Russian revolution.  As the Soviet Government had not yet re-established the school at that time, Vaganova began her teaching career at the privately owned ''School of Russian Ballet'' eventually joining the new ''Leningrad State Choreographic School'' in 1920.  Vaganova was to become possibly the most renowned ballet teacher of all time and is most noted for authoring &quot;The Principles of Classical Dance&quot;, which outlines the training system which she created and which heads the list of numerous works produced by teachers of the school. 

Vaganova's students would become some of the most famous ballet dancers of all time and in recognition of her achievements, the school was named in her honour in 1957, six years after her death.  There are a number of variations in the name of the school, but the official title in current use in the English speaking world is '''Vaganova Ballet Academy'''.

==Today==
===Overview===
The Vaganova Ballet Academy is one of the Worlds leading ballet schools and currently has over 300 students.  Like other similar institutions, competition for a place at the school is very fierce with over 3000 children auditioning each year, 300 of these being from St Petersburg.  Approximately 60 students are selected annually, with approximately 25 eventually graduating from the school having completed the full course of training.  The School employs approximately 75 dance teachers, 30 piano teachers, 40 academic teachers and 40 accompanists.  The Director of the school is Leonid Nadirov and the Artistic Director is former ''Kirov Ballet'' dancer and choreographer [[Altynai Asylmuratova]].

===Auditions===
Auditions for the school being in June and children must be at least 10 years old to apply.

The audition process is divided into three sections.
* Aptitude: to assess the candidate's proportions, height of jump, degree of turnout and general appearance etc 
* Physical: an examination by a specialist medical practitioner to assess the physiological possibilities of the candidate
* Artistic: to assess the candidate's musicality, rhythm, co-ordination and artistic talent

===Training===
All students at the school begin by studying a programme of dance training, secondary school level education, French language and piano lessons.  As they progress through the school, the programme becomes more intensive, with new subjects being added to the curriculum as the students become more advanced.  In the first year, students study classical and historical dance progressing to character dance in the fourth year and pas de deux and mime in the sixth year.  At the end of the 8th year of training, all students dance in a graduation gala at the Mariinsky Theatre.  The most successful students may be offered a contract with the Mariinsky Ballet company, with the majority seeking employment with ballet companies in Russia and worldwide, including leading companies such as the [[Bolshoi Ballet]], [[The Royal Ballet]] and [[American Ballet Theatre]].

The term [[custom wheel]] refers to the [[wheel]]s of a [[vehicle]] which have either been modified from the vehicle manufacturer's standard or have replaced the manufacturer's standard.

==Uses==
Custom wheels are one of the most common ways in which [[automobile]] enthusiasts customize their vehicles.  Competition-oriented enthusiasts typically switch to lighter, stronger, or larger wheels, while appearance-oriented enthusiasts more often choose larger and more visually distinctive wheels, inspired by those seen in [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] videos.

The most-desirable characteristics of custom wheels vary with owner's goals:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 ! Activity
 ! Primary characteristics considered
|-What What
| [[Automobile racing]]
| Weight
|-
| [[Drag racing]]
| Width (for traction)
|-
| [[rally (sports)|Rally]]
| Strength
|-
| [[Cruising (driving)|Street driving]]
| Visual appeal, weight (gas mileage)
|-
| [[Touring car racing]] and [[autocross]]ing
| Weight, width (less tire flex for better cornering performance)
|-
| Multi-purpose
| Strength, visual appeal, weight, width, achieved by maintaining multiple sets of wheels
|}

==Physics==
At some point, the performance advantage of larger wheels and reduced-profile tires meets the performance disadvantage of increased inertia and increased unsprung weight.  This point varies depending on the vehicle, style of wheel, and driving style; however, most vehicles do not see a performance increase when rims are more than two sizes larger than original-equipment specifications.  Appearance-oriented enthusiasts may feel that decreased performance and an increased risk of road damage from the use of oversized rims is a worthwhile price to pay for the look they want.

==Theft==
Newer aftermarket rims may be worth thousands of dollars, possibly exceeding the value of the vehicle to which they are attached.  Owners use special [[lug nut]]s, called wheel locks, to secure them, although it renders the vehicle difficult to service, and there are doubts as to how well the locks thwart determined thieves.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Vehicle leasing''' refers to [[leasing]] the use of a [[motor vehicle]] for a fixed or indefinite period of time. It is commonly offered by dealers as an alternative to vehicle purchase. The key difference in a lease is that after the lease expires, the lessee must return the vehicle to the dealer or buy it.

==Rationale==
Leasing offers advantages to both buyers and sellers. For the buyer, lease payments will usually be lower than payments on a car loan would be, and qualification is usually easier. Some consumers may prefer leasing as it allows them to simply return a car and select a new model when the lease expires, allowing a consumer to drive a new vehicle every few years without the responsibility of selling the old vehicles. A lessee does not have to worry about the future value of the vehicle, while a vehicle owner does.&lt;ref name=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/leasing/|title=FRB: Leasing Guide|accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the leasor, leasing generates income from a vehicle the leasor still owns and will be able to sell or lease again once the original lease has expired. As consumers will typically use a leased vehicle for a shorter period of time than one they buy outright, leasing may generate repeat customers more quickly, which may fit into various aspects of a dealer's business model.

==Lease agreement==
Lease agreements typically stipulate an early termination fee and limit the number of miles a lessee can drive (for passenger cars, a common number is 12,000 to 15,000 miles per year of the lease). If the mileage allowance is exceeded, fees may apply. Dealers will typically allow a lessee to negotiate a higher mileage allowance, for a higher lease payment. Lease agreements usually specify how much wear on the vehicle is allowable, and the lessee may face a fee if that amount of wear has been exceeded.&lt;ref name=&quot;fr&quot; /&gt;

The actual lease payments are calculated very similarly to the way loan payments are, but instead of an APR, the company uses something called the [[Money Factor]].

At the end of a lease's term, the lessee must either return the vehicle to the owner or purchase it. The end of lease price is usually agreed upon when the lease is signed.&lt;ref name=&quot;fr&quot; /&gt;

==Vehicle leasing in Australia==

[[Vehicle leasing]] is a common way for [[Australia|Australian]] businesses (including [[company|companies]], [[partnership|partnerships]] and [[sole trader|sole traders]]) to fund the purchase of [[car|cars]] and other [[vehicle|vehicles]].

There are three major types of [[vehicle leasing|vehicle lease]] used in [[Australia]]: 
* [[finance lease]], under which only the vehicle is leased,
* [[operating lease]], under which the vehicle and its running costs are packaged into the lease, and
* [[novated lease]], which is a form of [[salary packaging]] that some companies allow their employees to use to [[finance lease|lease]] a vehicle.

Each of these types of lease have distinctly different tax treatments under [[Taxation in Australia|Australian tax law]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{otheruses4|the legal mechanism used to secure the performance of obligations, including the payment of debts, with property|loans secured by mortgages, such as residential housing loans, and lending practices or requirements|Mortgage loan}}

{{PropertyLaw}}
A '''mortgage''' is the pledging of a [[real property|property]] to a [[lender]]  as a security for a [[mortgage loan]]. While a mortgage in itself is not a debt, it is evidence of a debt. It is a transfer of an interest in land, from the owner to the mortgage lender, on the condition that this interest will be returned to the owner of the real estate when the terms of the mortgage have been satisfied or performed. In other words, the mortgage is a [[security]] for the loan that the lender makes to the [[borrower]].

The term comes from the [[Old French]] &quot;dead pledge,&quot; apparently meaning that the pledge ends (dies) either when the obligation is fulfilled or the property is taken through [[foreclosure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|
first=Edward|last=Coke|authorlink=Edward Coke|
title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]|
quote=[I]f he doth not pay, then the Land which is put in pledge upon condition for the payment of the money, is taken from him for ever, and so dead to him upon condition, &amp;c. And if he doth pay the money, then the pledge is dead as to the Tenant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most jurisdictions mortgages are strongly associated with loans secured on [[real estate]] rather than other property (such as ships) and in some cases only land may be mortgaged. Arranging a mortgage is seen as the standard method by which individuals and businesses can purchase residential and commercial real estate  without the need to pay the full value immediately. See [[mortgage loan]] for residential mortgage lending, and [[commercial mortgage]] for lending against commercial property.

The measurement of a mortgage with regards to cost to the borrower can be measured by [[Annual Percentage Rate]] (APR) or many other formulas for true cost such as [[Lender Police Effective Annual Rate]] (LPEAR).

In many countries it is normal for home purchases to be funded by a mortgage. In countries where the demand for [[home ownership]] is highest, strong domestic markets have developed, notably in [[Spain]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] and the [[United States]]. 

== Participants and variant terminology ==
Legal systems, while having some concepts in common, employ different terminology.  However, in general, a mortgage of property involves the following parties.

===Mortgage lender===

Mortgagee is the legal term for the mortgage lender. The main function of the mortgage is to provide security to the lender. Given the large sum of money involved in financing a property, a mortgage lender will usually want security for the loan that will provide a claim upon that security and will take [[precedence]] over other [[creditors]]. A mortgage accomplishes this security.

The lender loans the money and [[registers]] the mortgage against the [[Title (property)|title]] to the property. The borrower gives the lender the mortgage as security for the loan, receives the funds, makes the required payments and maintains possession of the property. The borrower has the right to have the mortgage [[discharged]] from the title once the debt is paid.  If the mortgagor fails to repay the loan according to the conditions set forth by the lender, then the mortgagee reserves the right to [[foreclose]] on the property.

===Borrower===

Mortgagor is the legal term for the borrower, who owes the obligation secured by the mortgage, and may be multiple parties.  Generally, the debtor must meet the conditions of the underlying loan or other obligation and the conditions of the mortgage.  Otherwise, the debtor usually runs the risk of [[foreclosure]] of the mortgage by the creditor to recover the debt.  Typically the debtors will be the individual home-owners, landlords or businesses who are purchasing their property by way of a loan.

Most buyers of real property would have difficulty saving enough money to make an outright purchase of real estate. The use of debt increases a buyer's ability to buy through a combination of [[down payment]] and debt. As a result a real estate transaction seldom occurs without borrowers relying on borrowed funds.

====Borrowing for investment purposes====

Aside from the absence of large amount of available money, there are several reasons why an [[investor]] (including a buyer of real estate) might borrow funds. Some of these include:

*To [[diversify]] [[investments]] and reduce overall risk by using only part of the available funds for any one investment

*To invest the borrowed funds at a higher rate of interest (yield) than the borrowing rate; for example, a sum is borrowed at an [[annual interest rate]] of 7% and used to invest in a project that returns 10%

*To free up [[equity]] for other purposes; for example, a commercial enterprise may prefer to use funds to purchase inventory or equipment instead of investing only in land and buildings.

*To obtain a tax benefit. In some countries (such as Canada), mortgage interest is not tax deductible, but loans made for investment purposes are.

===Other participants===

Because of the complicated legal exchange, or [[conveyance]], of the property, one or both of the main participants are likely to require legal representation.  The terminology varies with legal jurisdiction; see [[lawyer]], [[solicitor]] and [[conveyancer]].   

Because of the complex nature of many markets the debtor may approach a [[mortgage broker]] or [[financial adviser]] to help them source an appropriate creditor, typically by finding the most competitive loan. 

The debt is, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, referred to as [[hypothecation]], which may make use of the services of a ''hypothecary'' to assist in the hypothecation.

==Default on Subdivided Property==

When a tract of land is purchased with a mortgage and then split up and sold off, then the &quot;inverse order of alienation rule applies&quot; to find out who will be liable for the default.  

Basically, when a mortgaged tract of land is split up and sold off, then upon default, the mortgagee forecloses and proceeds against lands still owned by the mortgagor, then liability attaches in a backward fashion, or in an 'inverse order' as they were sold.  So if A acquires a {{convert|3|acre|m2|sing=on}} lot by mortgage then splits up the lot into 3 1 acre lots (A, B, and C), and sells lot B to X, and then lot C to Y, retaining lot A for himself then, upon default, the mortgagee will go after lot A, the mortgagor, and if that sale does not satisfy the default, then the owner of lot C will be liable, then the owner of lot B.  The idea is that the first purchaser should have more equity and subsequent purchasers receive a diluted share.

== Legal aspects ==
There are essentially two types of legal mortgage.

===Mortgage by demise=== 

In a mortgage by demise, the creditor becomes the owner of the mortgaged property until the loan is repaid in full (known as &quot;redemption&quot;). This kind of mortgage takes the form of a conveyance of the property to the creditor, with a condition that the property will be returned on redemption.

This is an older form of legal mortgage and is less common than a mortgage by legal charge. In the UK, this type of mortgage is no longer available, by virtue of the [[Land Registration Act 2002]].

===Mortgage by legal charge=== 

In a mortgage by legal charge or technically &quot;a charge by deed expressed to be by way of legal mortgage&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;legal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&amp;PageNumber=84&amp;NavFrom=2&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=432552&amp;activetextdocid=432650|publisher= Ministry of Justice |title= Law of Property Act 1925 (c.20) Part III Mortgages, Rentcharges, and Powers of Attorney|accessdate=2008-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the debtor remains the legal owner of the property, but the creditor gains sufficient rights over it to enable them to enforce their security, such as a right to take possession of the property or sell it.

To protect the lender, a mortgage by legal charge is usually recorded in a public register. Since mortgage debt is often the largest debt owed by the debtor,  [[bank]]s and other mortgage lenders run title searches of the real property to make certain that there are no mortgages already registered on the debtor's property which might have higher priority.  [[Tax liens]], in some cases, will come ahead of mortgages.  For this reason, if a borrower has delinquent property taxes, the bank will often pay them to prevent the lienholder from [[Foreclosure|foreclosing]] and wiping out the mortgage.

This type of mortgage is common in the [[United States]] and, since the [[Law of Property Act 1925]],&lt;ref name=&quot;legal&quot;/&gt; it has been the usual form of mortgage in [[England and Wales]] (it is now the only form — see above).

In [[Scotland]], the mortgage by legal charge is also known as standard security.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}

In [[Pakistan]], the mortgage by legal charge is most common way used by banks to secure the financing.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} It is also known as registered mortgage. After registration of legal charge, the bank's lien is recorded in the land register stating that the property is under mortgage and cannot be sold without obtaining an NOC (No Objection Certificate) from the bank.

===Equitable mortgage===
{{See also|Security interest#Types of security}}

In an equitable mortgage the lender is secured by taking possession of all the original title documents of the property and by borrower's signing a Memorandum of Deposit of Title Deed (MODTD). This document is an undertaking by the borrower that he/she has deposited the title documents with the bank with his own wish and will, in order to secure the financing obtained from the bank.

== History ==
At [[common law]], a mortgage was a conveyance of land that on its face was absolute and conveyed a [[fee simple]] [[estate (law)|estate]], but which was in fact conditional, and would be of no effect if certain conditions were met &amp;mdash; usually, but not necessarily, the repayment of a debt to the original landowner.  Hence the word &quot;mortgage&quot; (a legal term in French meaning &quot;dead pledge&quot;).  The debt was absolute in form, and unlike a &quot;live pledge&quot; was not conditionally dependent on its repayment solely from raising and selling crops or livestock or simply giving the crops and livestock raised on the mortgaged land. The mortgage debt remained in effect whether or not the land could successfully produce enough income to repay the debt.  In theory, a mortgage required no further steps to be taken by the creditor, such as acceptance of crops and livestock in repayment.  

The difficulty with this arrangement was that the lender was absolute owner of the property and could sell it or refuse to reconvey it to the borrower, who was in a weak position. Increasingly the courts of [[Equity (law)|equity]] began to protect the borrower's interests, so that a borrower came to have an absolute right to insist on reconveyance on redemption. This right of the borrower is known as the &quot;[[equity of redemption]]&quot;.

This arrangement, whereby the lender was in theory the absolute owner, but in practice had few of the practical rights of ownership, was seen in many jurisdictions as being awkwardly artificial. By statute the common law's position was altered so that the mortgagor would retain ownership, but the mortgagee's rights, such as [[foreclosure]], the power of sale, and the right to take possession, would be protected.

In the United States, those states that have reformed the nature of mortgages in this way are known as [[lien]] states. A similar effect was achieved in England and Wales by the Law of Property Act 1925, which abolished mortgages by the conveyance of a fee simple.

==Foreclosure and non-recourse lending==
In most jurisdictions, a lender may [[foreclose]] on the mortgaged property if certain conditions — principally, non-payment of the mortgage loan — apply. Subject to local legal requirements, the property may then be sold. Any amounts received from the sale (net of costs) are applied to the original debt.

In some jurisdictions, mortgage loans are [[nonrecourse debt|non-recourse]] loans: if the funds recouped from sale of the mortgaged property are insufficient to cover the outstanding debt, the lender may not have recourse to the borrower after foreclosure. In other jurisdictions, the borrower remains responsible for any remaining debt, through a [[deficiency judgment]].

Specific procedures for foreclosure and sale of the mortgaged property almost always apply, and may be tightly regulated by the relevant government. In some jurisdictions, foreclosure and sale can occur quite rapidly, while in others, foreclosure may take many months or even years. In many countries, the ability of lenders to foreclose is extremely limited, and mortgage market development has been notably slower.

At the start of 2008, 5.6% of all mortgages in the United States were [[delinquent]]. &lt;ref&gt; ''Can the World Stop the Slide?'', '''TIME''', February 4, 2008, page 27. &lt;/ref&gt;  By the end of the first quarter that rate had risen, encompassing 6.4% of residential properties.  This number did not include the 2.5% of homes in foreclosure. &lt;ref&gt; Kemp, Carolyn. ''Delinquencies and Foreclosures Increase in Latest MBA National Delinquency Survey''. '''MortgageBankers.org'''. 5 June 2008. Mortgage Bankers Association. 19 June 2008 &lt;http://www.mortgagebankers.org/NewsandMedia/PressCenter/62936.htm.&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

== Mortgages in the United States ==
=== Types of mortgage instruments ===
Two types of mortgage instruments are commonly used in the United States: the mortgage (sometimes called a mortgage deed) and the deed of trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kratovil |first=Robert |coauthors=Werner, R. |title= Real Estate Law|edition=9th |publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc. |year=1988 |pages=Sec 20.09 |isbn=0-13-763343-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The mortgage====
In all but a few states, a mortgage creates a [[lien]] on the title to the mortgaged property.  [[Foreclosure]] of that lien almost always requires a judicial proceeding declaring the debt to be due and in default and ordering a sale of the property to pay the debt.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

====The deed of trust====
The deed of trust is a deed by the borrower to a trustee for the purposes of securing a debt.  In most states, it also merely creates a lien on the title and not a title transfer, regardless of its terms.  It differs from a mortgage in that, in many states, it can be [[Foreclosure|foreclosed]] by a non-judicial sale held by the trustee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kratovil |first=Robert |coauthors=Werner, R. |title= Real Estate Law|edition=9th |publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc. |year=1988 |pages=Sec 20.09(b) |isbn=0-13-763343-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also possible to foreclose them through a judicial proceeding.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

Most &quot;mortgages&quot; in California are actually deeds of trust.&lt;ref&gt;See the discussion of background principles of California real property law in ''Alliance Mortgage Co. v. Rothwell'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/10C4t1226.htm 10 Cal. 4th 1226], 1235-1238 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; The effective difference is that the foreclosure process can be much faster for a deed of trust than for a mortgage, on the order of 3 months rather than a year.  Because the foreclosure does not require actions by the court the transaction costs can be quite a bit less.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

Deeds of trust to secure repayments of debts should not be confused with [[trust instrument]]s that are sometimes called deeds of trust but that are used to create trusts for other purposes, such as estate planning.  Though there are superficial similarities in the form, many states hold deeds of trust to secure repayment of debts do not create true trust arrangements.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

===Mortgage lien priority===
Except in those few states in the United States that adhere to the title theory of mortgages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kratovil |first=Robert |coauthors=Werner, R. |title= Modern Mortgage Law and Practice |edition=2nd |publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc. |year=1981 |pages=Sec 1.6 |isbn=9780135957448}}&lt;/ref&gt; either a mortgage or a deed of trust will create a mortgage [[lien]] upon the title to the real property being mortgaged.  The lien is said to &quot;attach&quot; to the title when the mortgage is signed by the mortgagor and delivered to the mortgagee and the mortgagor receives the funds whose repayment the mortgage secures.  Subject to the requirements of the [[recording (real estate)|recording laws]] of the state in which the land is located, this attachment establishes the priority of the mortgage lien with respect to most other liens&lt;ref&gt;Exceptions include real estate tax liens and, in most states, [[mechanic's lien]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; on the property's title.&lt;ref&gt;The failure to record a previously made mortgage may, under some circumstances, allow a subsequent mortgagee's mortgage to be recognized as prior in right to the otherwise prior mortgage.&lt;/ref&gt; Liens that have attached to the title before the mortgage lien are said to be senior to, or prior to, the mortgage lien.  Those attaching afterward are said to be junior or subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;Of course, the lienholders can agree among themselves to a different priority arrangement through [[subordination (finance)|subordination arrangements]]. See, R. Kratovil and R. Werner ''Modern Mortgage Law and Practice'' Chs. 30 &amp; 38 (2nd Ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc.)&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this priority is to establish the order in which lien holders are entitled to [[foreclosure|foreclose]] their liens in an attempt to recover their debts. If there are multiple mortgage liens on the title to a property and the loan secured by a first mortgage is paid off, the second mortgage lien will move up in priority and become the new first mortgage lien on the title. Documenting this new priority arrangement will require the release of the mortgage securing the paid off loan.

{{Personal finance}}
'''Personal finance''' is the application of the principles of [[finance]] to the monetary decisions of an individual or family unit. It addresses the ways in which individuals or families obtain, [[personal budget|budget]], save and spend monetary resources over time, taking into account various financial risks and future life events. Components of personal finance might include [[checking account|checking]] and [[savings account]]s, [[credit card]]s and consumer [[loan]]s, investments in the [[stock market]], [[retirement plan]]s, [[social security]] benefits, [[insurance]] policies, and [[income tax]] management.

==Personal financial planning==
A key component of personal finance is financial planning, a dynamic process that requires regular monitoring and reevaluation. In general, it has five steps:
# '''Assessment''': One's personal financial situation can be assessed by compiling simplified versions of financial [[balance sheet]]s and [[income statement]]s. A personal balance sheet lists the values of personal [[asset]]s (e.g., car, house, clothes, stocks, bank account), along with personal [[liability|liabilities]] (e.g., credit card debt, bank loan, mortgage). A personal [[income statement]] lists personal [[income]] and [[expenses]].
# '''Setting goals''': Two examples are &quot;retire at age 65 with a personal net worth of $200,000&quot; and &quot;buy a house in 3 years paying a monthly mortgage servicing cost that is no more than 25% of my gross income&quot;. It is not uncommon to have several goals, some short term and some long term. Setting financial goals helps direct financial planning.
# '''Creating a plan''': The financial plan details how to accomplish your goals. It could include, for example, reducing unnecessary expenses, increasing one's employment income, or investing in the stock market.
# '''Execution''': Execution of one's personal financial plan often requires discipline and perseverance. Many people obtain assistance from professionals such as accountants, financial planners, investment advisers, and lawyers.
# '''Monitoring and reassessment''': As time passes, one's personal financial plan must be monitored for possible adjustments or reassessments.

Typical goals most adults have are paying off credit card and or student loan debt, retirement, college costs for children, medical expenses, and estate planning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''contract of employment''' is a category of [[contract]] used in [[labour law]] to attribute right and responsibilities between parties to a bargain. On the one end stands an &quot;employee&quot; who is &quot;employed&quot; by an &quot;employer&quot;. It has arisen out of the old master-servant law, used before the 20th century. Put generally, the contract of employment denotes a relationship of economic dependence and social subordination. In the words of the influential labour lawyer Sir [[Otto Kahn-Freund]], 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;the relation between an employer and an isolated employee or worker is typically a relation between a bearer of power and one who is not a bearer of power. In its inception it is an act of submission, in its operation it is a condition of subordination, however much the submission and the subordination may be concealed by the indispensable figment of the legal mind known as the 'contract of employment'. The main object of labour law has been, and I venture to say will always be a countervailing force to counteract the inequality of bargaining power which is inherent and must be inherent in the employment relationship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Labour and the Law'', Hamlyn Lectures, 1972, 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Terminology==
A contract of employment is usually defined to mean the same as a &quot;[[contract of service]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;in the UK, s.230 [[Employment Rights Act 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt; A contract of service has historically been distinguished from a &quot;[[contract for services]]&quot;, the expression altered to imply the dividing line between a person who is &quot;employed&quot; and someone who is &quot;self employed&quot;. The purpose of the dividing line is to attribute rights to some kinds of people who work from others. This could be the right to a minimum wage, holiday pay, sick leave, fair dismissal, a written statement of the contract, the right to organise in a [[union]], and so on. The assumption is that genuinely self employed people should be able to look after their own affairs, and therefore work they do for others should not carry with it an obligation to look after these rights.

In [[Roman law]] the equivalent dichotomy was that between ''locatio conductio operarum'' and ''locatio conductio operis'' (lit. hire of services and of service).&lt;ref&gt;see, Sir John MacDonell, ''Classification of Forms and Contracts of Labour'' (1904) Journal of the Society of Comparative Legislation, New Series, Vol. 5, No. 2, pp. 253-261, at 255-256&lt;/ref&gt; 

The terminology is complicated by the use of many other sorts of contracts involving one person doing work for another. Instead of being considered an &quot;employee&quot;, the individual could be considered a &quot;[[worker]]&quot; (which could mean less employment legislation protection) or as having an &quot;employment relationship&quot; (which could mean protection somewhere in between) or a &quot;professional&quot; or a &quot;dependent entrepreneur&quot;, and so on. Different countries will take more or less sophisticated, or complicated approaches to the question.

==Terms and conditions of employment==
The focus of most employment contracts is [[wage]]s for work. Essential terms might be notice periods in the event of dismissal, holiday pay rights, the place of work and pension schemes. Many jurisdictions require these factors to be set out in a written contract.&lt;ref&gt;In the European Union, see Directive 91/533&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of pay, the employee may be compensated through [[wage]]s, a [[salary]], or by [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]]. In addition to monetary compensation, the employment contract often specifies a [[fringe benefit]] package, including a [[retirement plan]], [[employee stock option]]s, [[holiday]] entitlement, required hours of work, and (especially in the US) [[health insurance]] benefits.

Normally, such contracts provide for termination of employment, by either party, and include associated matters such as notice period, compensation arrangements and, sometimes, [[garden leave]].

Some employers use [[Non-disclosure agreement|non-disclosure]] and [[non-compete clause]]s to protect their [[trade secret]]s from being dispersed when employees leave. Depending on where people live, the laws regarding enforceability of these clauses vary widely.

UK law holds that employment contracts have implied terms (assumed, unspoken, essential terms ), as well as explicit terms (typically those in writing). Legal precedent provides for example that there is an implied contractual term of trust and confidence, meaning each party to the contract is expected to behave in a manner allowing the other to maintain trust and confidence in the other.

A '''small business''' may be defined as a [[business]] with a small number of [[employee]]s. The legal definition of &quot;small&quot; often varies by country and industry, but is generally under 100 [[employee]]s in the [[United States]] while under 50 [[employee]]s in the [[European Union]] (In comparison, the [[United States|American]] definition of '''mid-sized business''' by the number of [[employee]]s is generally under 500 while 250 is for that of [[European Union]]).  These businesses are normally privately owned [[corporations]], [[partnership]]s, or [[sole proprietorship]]s. In Australia, small business is defined as 1-19 employees and medium businesses are made up of 20-200 employees.

However, other methods are also used to classify small companies, such us annual sales (turnover), assets value or net profit (balance sheet), alone or in a mixed definition. These criteria are followed by the European Union, for instance (headcount, turnover and balance sheet totals).

Small businesses are common in many countries, depending on the economic system in operation.  Typical examples include: [[convenience store]]s, other small shops (such as a [[bakery]] or [[delicatessen]]), [[cosmetologist|hairdressers]], [[tradesman|tradesmen]], [[solicitor]]s, [[lawyer]]s, [[accountant]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[motel|guest houses]], [[photographer]]s, small-scale [[manufacturing]] etc.  Small businesses are usually [[independent business|independent]].

The smallest businesses, often located in private homes, are called '''microbusinesses''' (term used by international organizations such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Finance Corporation]]) or [[Small office/home office|SoHos]]. The term '''&quot;mom and pop business&quot;''' is a common colloquial expression for a single-family operated business with few (or no) employees other than the owners.  When judged by the number of employees, the [[United States|American]] and the [[Europe]]an definitions are the same:  under 10 [[employee]]s. 

==Advantages of small business==

A small business can be started at a very low cost and on a part-time basis.  Small business is also well suited to [[internet]] [[marketing]] because it can be very manageable to serve a niche, something that would have been more difficult prior to the internet revolution which began in the late 1990s.

Adapting to change is crucial in business and particularly small business; not being tied to any [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] inertia, it is typically easier to respond to the marketplace quickly.  Small business proprietors tend to be intimate with their customers and clients resulting in greater accountability and responsiveness.

Several organizations also provide help for the small business, like Internal Revenue Service in Small Business and Self-Employed One-Stop Resource.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/ Small Business and Self-Employed One-Stop Resource&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems faced by small businesses==

Small  businesses often face a variety of problems related to their size.  A frequent cause of [[bankruptcy]] is [[undercapitalization]].  This is often a result of poor planning rather than economic conditions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sba.gov/smallbusinessplanner/start/financestartup/SERV_FINANBASICS.html Small Business Administration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; - it is common rule of thumb that the [[entrepreneur]] should have access to a sum of money at least equal to the projected revenue for the first year of business in addition to his anticipated expenses.  For example, if the prospective owner thinks that he will generate $100,000 in revenues in the first year with $150,000 in start-up expenses, then he should have no less than $250,000 available.  Failure to provide this level of funding for the company could leave the owner liable for all of the company's debt should he end up in bankruptcy [[court]], under the theory of [[undercapitalization]].

In addition to ensuring that the business has enough capital, the small business owner must also be mindful of [[gross margin]] ([[sales]] minus [[variable cost]]s).  To break even, the business must be able to reach a level of sales where the gross margin exceeds [[fixed cost]]s.  When they first start out, many small business owners underprice their products to a point where even at their maximum capacity, it would be impossible to break even.  The good news is that [[cost control]]s or a price increase can often resolve this problem.

In the [[United States]], some of the largest concerns of small business owners are [[insurance]] costs (such as [[liability]] and [[health insurance|health]]), rising [[petroleum|energy]] costs and [[tax]]es.  In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]], small business owners tend to be more concerned with excessive governmental [[red tape]].{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

Another problem for many small businesses is termed the 'Entrepreneurial Myth' or [[E-Myth]].  The [[mythic]] assumption is that an expert in a given technical field will also be expert at running that kind of business.  Additional business management skills are needed to keep a business running smoothly.

==Marketing the small business==
Common marketing techniques for small business include networking, word of mouth, customer referrals, yellow pages directories, television, radio, outdoor (roadside billboards), print, email marketing, and internet.  Electronic media like TV can be quite expensive and is normally intended to create awareness of a product or service.  

Many small business owners find internet marketing more affordable. [[Google AdWords]] and [[Yahoo! Search Marketing]] are two popular options of getting small business products or services in front of motivated Web searchers. Advertising on [[Niche market|niche]] sites can also be effective, but with the [[long tail]] of the internet, it can be time intensive to advertise on enough sites to garner an effective [[Reach (advertising)|reach]].

==Franchise businesses==
[[Franchising]] is a way for small business owners to benefit from the economies of scale of the big corporation (franchisor).  McDonald's restaurants, TrueValue hardware stores, and NAPA Auto Parts stores are examples of a franchise.  The small business owner can leverage a strong brand name and purchasing power of the larger company while keeping their own investment affordable.  However, some franchisees conclude that they suffer the &quot;worst of both worlds&quot; feeling they are too restricted by corporate mandates and lack true independence. However, in some chains, such as the aforementioned TrueValue and NAPA, franchises may have their own name alongside the franchise's name.

==Mom and pop small businesses==

In North American English small or micro businesses that are family-owned and family-operated may be termed Mom and Pop businesses.  People who speak of mom and pop businesses often refer to the unique perspective offered by patronizing a family business.  Some encourage the unknown experience of entering a mom and pop establishment over patronizing franchise businesses, which typically offer comparable stores and similar consumer experiences, regardless of location.  For example, mom and pop businesses are often highlighted in travel guides, because patronizing a family-owned and operated business allows a traveler to more fully experience and understand the people of another culture.

==Small business bankruptcy==
When small business fails, the owner may file bankruptcy.  In most cases this can be handled through a personal bankruptcy filing.  Corporations can file bankruptcy, but if it is out of business and valuable corporate assets are likely to be repossessed by secured creditors there is little advantage to going to the expense of a corporate bankruptcy.  Many states offer exemptions for small business assets so they can continue to operate during and after personal bankruptcy.  However, corporate assets are normally not exempt, hence it may be more difficult to continue operating an incorporated business if the owner files bankruptcy.

===Certification and trust===
Building trust with new customers can be a difficult task for a new and establishing business. Some organizations like the [[Better Business Bureau]] and the [[International Charter]] now offer Small Business [[Professional certification|Certification]], which certifies the quality of the services and goods produced and can encourage new and larger customers. These services may require a few hours of work, but a certification may reassure potential customers.  However, the most effective way to earn trust is through customer referrals.

===Contribution to the economy===
Small Businesses are the major job providers in most economies.  The top job provider is those with less than 10 [[employee]]s, and those with 10 or more but less than 20 [[employee]]s comes in as the second, and those with 20 or more but less than 50 [[employee]]s comes in as the third.

==Sources of funding==
Small businesses use several sources available for start-up [[Financial capital|capital]]:
*Self-financing by the owner through Cash, [[Ownership equity|equity]] [[loan]] on his or her home, and or other assets.
*Loans from friends or relatives
*Private [[stock]] issue
*Forming [[partnerships]]
*[[Angel Investors]]
*[[SME finance]], including Collateral based lending and [[Venture capital]], given sufficiently sound business venture plans
Some small businesses are further financed through [[credit card]] debt - usually a poor choice, given that the interest rate on credit cards is often several times the rate that would be paid on a line of credit or [[bank]] [[loan]].  Many owners seek a bank loan in the name of their business, however banks will usually insist on a personal guarantee by the business owner.  In the [[United States]], the [[Small Business Administration]] (SBA) runs several loan programs that may help a small business secure loans.  In these programs, the SBA guarantees a portion of the loan to the issuing bank and thus relieves the bank of some of the risk of extending the loan to a small business. The SBA also requires business owners to pledge personal assets and sign as a personal guarantee for the loan.

Canadian small businesses can take advantage of federally funded programs and services.  See [[Federal financing for small businesses in Canada (grants and loans)]].

==International differences==
The challenges facing small business owners vary from country to country, based on the overall business climate as well as the regulatory framework of each geographic location. It is extremely important for business owners to understand the legal requirements and obligations in their particular country of operation.

'''''Ghost Whisperer''''' is an [[Emmy Award]] nominated [[United States|American]] [[Television drama series|television drama]]-[[Fantasy television|fantasy]]-[[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] that premiered on [[CBS]] [[September 23]], [[2005]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/ghost-whisperer/cast/192254 Ghost Whisperer Cast &amp; Details], [[TV Guide]] website, accessed 7 February, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The show was created by [[John Gray (director)|John Gray]].

==Plot Synopsis==
''Ghost Whisperer'' is an episodic series that follows the life of [[Melinda Gordon]], a young woman who has the ability to see and communicate with the dead. Each episode deals with one or more ghosts seeking Melinda's help in relaying a message or completing a task that will put the spirit to rest, and allow them to &quot;cross over&quot; into The Light, a metaphor presented by the show as its conception of [[Heaven]]. Crossing over is when a spirit leaves earth and goes to heaven.

Despite the episodic structure of the show, plot lines that span two or three episodes (normally during season openers and finishers) develop and progress throughout the rest of the season. The first season arc introduced the show's first antagonist, Romano, a negative entity in a black hat, who attempted to do the exact opposite of Melinda and gather earthbound souls and bring them to the Dark Side. The story climaxed in the season finale when a plane crashed in Grandview, and Melinda and Romano both attempted to sway the souls to the Light, and staying on earth, respectively. Her Best Friend [[Andrea Marino]] was killed in the plane crash and, in a story that would carry over to the second season, was being swayed by Romano to stay earthbound.

In the second season, two new characters ([[Delia Banks]] and [[Professor Rick Payne]]) are introduced, both of whom, by season's end, come to learn of Melinda's power and become survivors that ghosts want messages passed to through Melinda. The second season arc revolves around the thinning &quot;veil&quot; between the living and the dead, evident in certain situations in second season episodes. By the end of the season, a second Ghost Whisperer was introduced. His arrival in Grandview sets the final events of a disastrous prophecy in motion, and the strengthening of the dark side over the Light.

The beginning of each episode normally revolves around Melinda first encountering the ghost(s) that will be crossed over in the episode. In their normally brief appearances, Melinda collects clues she later researches. After gaining a significant piece of information that drives the episode's plot further, the ghost(s) normally open up to her, and tell her how it is she can help them find peace. Often, the messages the ghosts want Melinda to pass are confusing and as a result, she is normally met with questions and scepticism by those she is trying to give the message to the families, friends and lovers of the ghosts. By the end of each episode, Melinda is usually able to complete her task and cross the ghost(s) from the respective episode over.

==Production notes==
The series is based on the work of &quot;Spirit Communicator&quot; [[James Van Praagh]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etonline.com/tv/35533/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; who is co-[[executive producer]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vanpraagh.com/Ghost_CBS.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; and constantly updates a [[blog]] about the show through CBS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.com/primetime/ghost_whisperer/blog.php Ghost Whisperer on Ghost Whisperer on CBS]&lt;/ref&gt; The stories are also said to be based in part on the work of &quot;Spirit Communicator&quot; [[Mary Ann Winkowski]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8423881/ Real-life ‘Ghost Whisperer’ inspires CBS - TV dramas - MSNBC.com]&lt;/ref&gt;. Development of the show dates back to at least two years before its premiere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.com/primetime/ghost_whisperer/archive_blog.php Ghost Whisperer on Ghost Whisperer on CBS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is currently produced by Sander/Moses Productions in association with [[CBS Paramount Network Television]] (originally [[CBS Productions]] in season one) and [[ABC Studios]] (originally Touchstone Television in the first two seasons).
 
The show is filmed on the [[Universal Studios]] back lot in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalstudioshollywood.com/vi_news.html Universal Studios Hollywood - What's New]&lt;/ref&gt; One area on the lot is [[Courthouse Square]] from the [[Back to the Future trilogy|''Back to the Future'' trilogy]], though it has been drastically modified to portray Grandview. For example, the [[clock tower]] present in ''Back to the Future'' has been completely covered up. Cast and crew members also believe that the set gets visits from real spirits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=1&amp;id=40876 SCI FI Wire | The News Service of the SCI FI Channel | SCIFI.COM]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the season one finale, John Gray, the show's creator, signed a two-year contract with CBS, which would all but guarantee a third season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scifi.about.com/blhail340.htm Sci-Fi / Fantasy]&lt;/ref&gt; Season three is also supposed to bring about new executive producer P.K.

==Afterlife in Ghost Whisperer==

There are two places in afterlife, when the ghosts &quot;cross over&quot;: The Light and the Dark Side. These two places are one of the main points of the show.

===The Light===
When Melinda helps ghosts cross over, they see a bright light. The Light is identified with [[Heaven]]. The Light is invisible to viewers and shown only a few times such as in episodes The Vanishing, The One, Giving up the Ghost (briefly) and The Gathering. Almost all the spirits in the show cross over into the light.

===The Dark Side===
Not all spirits cross over into the Light. Some cross over to the Dark Side. The Dark Side is identified with [[Hell]]. Spirits who are trapped in this [[Confusion|Limbo]] are exposed to hate and anger.

However, some ghosts remain on earth trapped, whether it be because of an evil force, or unfinished business. Some may not even know they are dead. These spirits can reside above the surface (such as ghosts that haunt people) or in The Underneath (where evil spirits stay).

==Internet promotion==
===The Other Side===
A series of [[webisodes]] entitled ''Ghost Whisperer: The Other Side'' have been released on the ''Ghost Whisperer'' website.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.cbs.com/ghost The Other Side 2 - Ghost Whisperer on CBS]&lt;/ref&gt; A total of eight webisodes were produced and extras (such as trailers and behind the scenes) are available for viewing. The story follows Zach (played by Mark Hapka), a young delivery boy who dies while delivering a package. He soon learns how to do things in the spirit world, and gets revenge on  Danny, the man he thinks killed him, and his former best friend. Melinda from the television series doesn't appear in the internet series as it takes place entirely in the spirit world.  However, ghosts from the television series have appeared in some webisodes.

In the second season finale of ''Ghost Whisperer'', one of the characters from ''The Other Side'', Mark, made an appearance while trying to get help from Melinda before being taken into the Dark Side leaving the internet series in its own cliffhanger.

The second season of ''The Other Side'' will screen on the CBS website starting 18 January 2008.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===andshamethedevil.net===
It has been recently discovered that andshamethedevil.net&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andshamethedevil.net and|SHAME|the|devil]&lt;/ref&gt; is a site linked to Ghost Whisperer. The site is mentioned in the Season 3 premiere. If you visit the site and click on the word bloody, it leads to another site rubloodymary.com

Also, recently discovered: If you click on the star in the upper right hand corner, the site appears to crack into pieces. Those pieces can be removed by dragging, revealing this message:

&quot;Meet Me In The Underworld&quot;

Also in really tiny letters at the bottom read the words: &quot;bloody mary.  bloody marry.  bloody mary.&quot;

===rubloodymary.com===
Another site discovered to be a part of Ghost Whisperer. rubloodymary.com is mentioned in episode 302 - &quot;Don't Try This At Home&quot; - which prominently features the Bloody Mary Urban Legend. When visiting rubloodymary.com if you click and hold down anywhere on the main page and scrub you can erase the image, revealing another image underneath that reads &quot;...until she is trapped underground.&quot; Above that there is a countdown timer that, doing the math, counts down to Friday, [[October 26]], [[2007]], episode 305 of Ghost Whisperer aired that night.

Other features: There is a stories link that takes you to a book with a Bloody Mary tale in it.  The very last line reads &quot;I hope she doesn't go in the church.&quot;

Finally, there is an email address to connect to, and several links, some to the Ghost Whisperer Myspace page and ghostwhisperer.com and one that links back to andshamethedevil.net which is another secret Ghost Whisperer site.

'''''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock''''' is a [[music video game]] developed by [[Neversoft]] published by [[Activision]] and [[RedOctane]]. It is the third full installment in the [[Guitar Hero (series)|''Guitar Hero'' series]], and the fourth title overall. ''Guitar Hero III'' was first released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], with the [[PlayStation 2]] version developed through [[Budcat Creations]] and the [[Wii]] version through [[Vicarious Visions]].  [[Aspyr Media]] assisted in porting the game to the [[Personal computer|PC]], and [[Macintosh|Mac]] platforms in late 2007.  Due to the acquisition of RedOctane by Activision, [[Harmonix Music Systems]] is no longer involved in developing titles in the ''Guitar Hero'' series; instead, they developed the competing ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]''.  

''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' retains the same gameplay as the other games in the series.  The player uses a special guitar-shaped controller to simulate the playing of [[rock music]] by playing in-time to scrolling [[note]]s on-screen.  ''Guitar Hero III'' includes a new cooperative career mode and &quot;Boss Battles&quot; against both in-game characters and other players; the game is also the first in the series to allow for online play for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii versions.  The game features over 70 total songs shipped on disk, many of which, in contrast to previous games, are master tracks.  The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions also feature the ability to download additional songs.   Several musicians appear in ''Guitar Hero 3'', including [[Tom Morello]] (of the bands [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Audioslave]]) and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] (of the bands [[Guns N' Roses]] and [[Velvet Revolver]]) as in-game characters. The [[Personal computer|PC]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]] versions also include [[Bret Michaels]] (of the band [[Poison (band)|Poison]]).

The game was well-received, though reviewers noted the difference in the feel of the game compared to the previous installments due to the change of developer.  The game was the best-selling video game of 2007, both in terms of units sold and revenue earned.&lt;ref name=&quot;gt-sales&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamertell.com/gaming/comment/guitar-hero-rocks-1-billion-sales-mark/ | title = Guitar Hero rocks $1 billion sales mark | publisher = GamerTell | first = Pulkit | last = Chandna | date = [[2008-01-23]] | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{see also|Guitar Hero (series)#Common gameplay elements|l1=Common gameplay elements in the Guitar Hero series}}
The ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' gameplay remains unchanged from previous titles in the series; the player must hit notes as they scroll towards the bottom of the screen in time with music in order to maintain their performance and to score points.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt; Hitting notes using the guitar controller requires strumming the strum bar while holding down the correct fret button(s). Playing with the standard controller only requires the correct button to be pressed.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt; Notes can be sustained (in which the fret button(s) must remain held until the note is complete) and can also form a chord (two or three notes played together; however the song &quot;[[Go That Far]]&quot; by the [[Bret Michaels|Bret Michaels Band]] features four note chords on the [[rhythm guitar]] track on expert difficulty. It is the first song that features four note chords in the ''Guitar Hero'' series; the Joe Perry Guitar Battle in ''[[Guitar Hero: Aerosmith]]'' and &quot;[[Pride and Joy (Stevie Ray Vaughan song)|Pride and Joy]]&quot; in ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour]]'' are the only other songs in the series which feature a four-note chord.). The game also simulates [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s for sections with a rapid series of notes. Missing a note will cause a performance meter to drop; if this meter drops too low, the player will fail the song, represented in-game by the band being booed off the stage. A string of 10 consecutive correct notes earns a multiplier to increase the player's score (up until four times), and special sections, marked by starred notes, can be used to build Star Power; when released (by tilting the guitar controller up vertically or hitting a button on a standard controller), the player's multiplier is doubled, the performance meter increases faster when a correct note is hit, and there is less of a penalty for missing notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt; As with the previous games in the series, ''Guitar Hero III'' contains four difficulty levels: Easy (which uses three of the fret buttons); Medium (which makes use of four of the fret buttons); Hard (which utilizes all five fret buttons); and Expert (which adds no new fret buttons, but increases the number of notes and the general difficulty).&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year=2007 | editor=[[Neversoft]] | title=Guitar Hero III instruction manual | publisher=[[Activision]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career mode===
As with previous ''Guitar Hero'' games, a player will progress through multiple tiers of songs, unlocking new songs along the way. The single player career mode in ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' features 8 tiers with 42 songs total.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt; The player is required to complete a number of songs in each tier, the number depending on the difficulty level, and then is offered an encore performance with one additional song. After a tier is complete, a new tier is introduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt; New in ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' are career mode boss battles; at three points during the career mode, the player is required to compete against a boss character: [[Tom Morello]], [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], and [[Lucifer|Lou the Devil]], in order to progress. Each successfully completed song earns in-game money that the player can use at the game's store to unlock new characters, outfits, guitars and finishes, bonus songs, and videos. Additionally, beating a song in career mode unlocks it for play in all other game modes.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt;

''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' is the first game in the series to feature a storyline for the Career mode, portrayed through animated cartoon scenes in between venues.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt; The band starts out as a neighborhood sensation, before hooking up with a record producer named Lou at one of their shows. After a successful music video hits the web, the band travels to England, and then performs at an island jail (despite Lou encouraging them to 'sell out'), which ends up boosting the band's popularity. As a result, they are invited to headline the ''Desert Rock Tour'' festival.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt; After a botched performance in Japan (thanks to Lou) they attempt to break free of their contract with Lou, who then reveals himself to be the Devil and the contract as ownership of their souls. The band is dragged down to Lou's &quot;Inferno&quot;, where the final showdown comes. In this final showdown, the player must defeat Lou in a boss battle to earn back the band's souls, and the title of &quot;Rock Legend&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt;

===Co-op career mode===
Two players using the same console can participate in Co-op Career Mode, which is arranged similarly to the single player Career mode, with one player on [[lead guitar]] and the other on [[bass guitar|bass]] or [[rhythm guitar]]. There are only 6 tiers of songs, with each encore song being unique to the co-op mode. There are no boss battles in this mode.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt;

The co-op storyline portrays the vocalist and drummer looking for a guitarist and bassist. After their first performance, the drummer has the idea of making a video to make a name for the band. The video skyrockets the band's popularity, earning them a gig in Japan, but differences between the core members put the band on a three-month hiatus. In the band's comeback performance, the pyrotechnics start a fire in the neighborhood, and the members are sent to jail, where Lou bails them out as long as they perform for the inmates. As soon as the band leaves prison, though, they are sent to Lou's &quot;Inferno&quot;, where they must find their way out by playing a live show.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt;

===Battle mode===
[[Image:Guitar-hero-3-gameplay.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A screenshot demonstrating Battle Mode and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] as a playable character.]]
''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' introduced Battle Mode, a competitive mode between two players either locally or over network play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/793/793302p1.html | title = ''Guitar Hero III'': Battle Mode | publisher = [[IGN]] | first = Erik | last = Brudvig | date = 2007-06-01 | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mode puts a twist on the Pro Face-off mode introduced in ''Guitar Hero II''. Two players compete against each other, trying to make his or her opponent fail or lose by successfully playing &quot;Battle Power&quot; sequences (which replaces Star Power) to earn attacks that can be used against the opponent. Players can store three attacks at a time. To activate these temporary attacks, the player tilts his or her guitar upward, presses the select button (PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 releases), back button (Xbox 360 release), or minus button (Wii release). If neither player fails the song, they will face each other in a Sudden Death segment, where all further &quot;Battle Powers&quot; attainable are Death Drain attacks, which inevitably makes the opponent fail by draining his or her Rock Meter.&lt;ref name=&quot;manual&quot; /&gt;

===Wii exclusive features===
[[Image:Guitar Hero 3 guitar for the Wii-cropped.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Guitar for the Wii version with Wii Remote]]
The [[Wii]] version of the game has several exclusive features, since a [[Wii Remote]] must be inserted into the guitar controller. The game utilizes the Wii Remote's wireless capabilities and accelerometer, as well as making use of the rumble feature and the internal speaker:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wii.ign.com/articles/816/816619p1.html | title = ''Guitar Hero III'' for Wii Hands-on | last = Harris | first = Craig | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2007-08-29]] | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The internal speaker on the Wii Remote is used to emit a sound simulating the guitar strings when incorrect notes are hit; This feature, however, can be turned off in the player's interest. The Wii Remote's rumble feature is utilized when Star Power mode is activated. While the Wii version has online play against other online strangers, or against friends utilizing game-specific [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection#Friend codes|friend codes]], downloadable content was not available at launch. Activision had announced that it would be releasing downloadable content for the Wii in the first quarter of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-24|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3164807|title=GH3 Wii Getting Replacement Discs in 2008 |publisher=[[1UP.com]]|date=2007-12-07|author=Watts, Steve }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is delayed with a revised release date currently unannounced. The Wii and PlayStation 2 versions also use slightly different graphics and sounds from those on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, such as a different typeset, loading screen, and the Wii version featuring &quot;miss&quot; sounds more akin to the first ''Guitar Hero'' and ''Guitar Hero II''. However, in the new remastered Wii game disc, the &quot;miss&quot; sounds have been changed to those heard in the other versions. The Wii version of the game includes characters that are not found in the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, Elroy Budvis and Metalhead.

===Characters===

Neversoft lead developer Alan Flores revealed that ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' has a cast of thirteen characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;flores&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/video/939093/6175095/videoplayerpop | title = ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' Stage Demo | accessdate = 2008-07-24 | date = 2007-07-13 | publisher = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters returning from previous titles are Johnny Napalm, Judy Nails, Axel Steel, Izzy Sparks, Casey Lynch, Lars Ümlaüt, and Xavier Stone. Midori is an original playable character that can be selected; additionally, each system has two additional playable characters that can be unlocked: the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions include the characters of Metalhead and Elroy Budvis, while the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC versions include The God of Rock and The Grim Ripper.

In addition, the player can unlock the three boss characters: [[Tom Morello]],&lt;ref name=&quot;gamepro&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamepro.com/video/player.cfm?vid=112920 | title = GamePro.com Video: Exclusive ''Guitar Hero III'' Preview! - GP Original Series | accessdate = 2008-07-24 | date = 2007-08-23 | publisher = [[GamePro]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slash (musician)|Slash]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://media.ps3.ign.com/media/858/858010/vid_2053850.html | title = Slash Guitar Battle (E3 2007 Off Screen) | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2007-07-12]] | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lou the Devil, once they have completed their respective boss battles in career mode. While [[Bret Michaels]] appears in the game and sings specific songs, he is not a playable character in the game. Michaels is only included in the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC versions of the game. However, his motion-captured movements are all done for the in-game fictional singer for all versions, including the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions.

==Development==
In May 2006, [[RedOctane]], the publisher of ''[[Guitar Hero (video game)|Guitar Hero]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'', and ''[[Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s]]'', was purchased by [[Activision]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Activision Paid $100 mln for RedOctane|url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/activision-paid-100-mln-redoctane|publisher=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|first=Kris|last=Graff|date=2006-08-09|accessdate=2007-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[MTV]] bought the developer of previous ''Guitar Hero'' games, [[Harmonix Music Systems|Harmonix]], in September of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3153935|title=MTV Buys Harmonix for $175M|accessdate=2008-07-24|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|first=Patrick|last=Klepek|date=2006-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of both purchases, ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' was instead published by Activision, with development responsibilities shifting from Harmonix to [[Neversoft|Neversoft Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = ''Tony Hawk&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s'' ''Guitar Hero''? | url = http://ps3.ign.com/articles/755/755984p1.html | publisher = [[IGN]] | first = Hilary | last = Goldstein | date = [[2007-01-17]] | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neversoft president Joel Jewett noted that his company was asked to perform the development work based on a humorous conversation that Jewett had with RedOctane's founders Kai and Charles Huang at the 2006 [[E3 Media and Business Summit|E3 Convention]], describing how ''Guitar Hero'' helped to reduce the stress in the Neversoft offices during their development of ''[[Tony Hawk's Project 8]]''; months later, Jewett was contacted by the Huangs, requesting them to work on ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=598 | title = How Neversoft Took Over ''Guitar Hero'' | first = Chris | last = Faylor | publisher = [[Shacknews]] | date = 2007-09-26 | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activision initially stated that the game was planned for release in the fiscal year of 2008, which stretches from March 2007 to March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = New ''Call of Duty'', ''Guitar Hero'', and 007 coming in 2007–8 69 | url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/puzzle/guitarhero2/news.html?sid=6155242 | publisher = [[GameSpot]] | first = Tor | last = Thorsen | date = 2006-08-03 | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[April 9]] [[2007]], RedOctane clarified this by unofficially stating on their website that &quot;Guitar Hero 3 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii are currently scheduled for release in the United States in Fall of 2007.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ''Guitar Hero 3'' this Fall | url = http://au.wii.ign.com/articles/779/779325p1.html | publisher = [[IGN]] | first = Hilary | last = Goldstein | date = 2007-04-09 | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[April 16]], [[2007]], RedOctane founder Kai Huang revealed that all versions of the game would feature wireless controllers as well as online multiplayer and downloadable content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ''Guitar Hero III'' will add online multiplayer, wireless | url = http://www.gamespot.com/news/6169126.html | publisher = [[GameSpot]] | first = Emma | last = Boyes | date = 2007-04-16 | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' was officially announced by Activision and RedOctane on [[May 23]] [[2007]] for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360. The fall 2007 release date was reconfirmed. New wireless controllers shaped like a [[Gibson Les Paul]] (PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox 360) and [[Kramer Guitars|Kramer Striker]] (PlayStation 2) models were confirmed, along with removable faceplates that will allow players to personalize their guitar. Activision avoided all mention of the title &quot;''Guitar Hero III''&quot;, instead referring to the game as &quot;the next ''Guitar Hero''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-24|url=http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2007/05/23/next-guitar-hero-details-tracks-wireless-guitars-and-online-play|title=Next Guitar Hero details: tracks, wireless guitars, and online play |publisher=[[Ars Technica]]|date=2007-05-23|author=Kuchera, Ben }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dusty Welch, head of publishing at RedOctane, promised &quot;new online and multi-player game play modes&quot;, and that &quot;many of the top bands and songs we've tried to get in the past are now on board, and we've definitely got some giant aces in the hole to say the least.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Activision Shreds New Details on Next Guitar Hero Game|publisher=[[Activision]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/wii/puzzle/guitarhero/news.html?sid=6171409|accessdate=2008-07-24|date=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online play feature will extend to the Wii version, as announced by Nintendo at the 2007 [[E3]] conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/47885 | title = E3 07: ''Mario Kart'', EA Sports, ''Guitar Hero 3'' Online on Wii | first = Chris | last = Remo | publisher = [[Shacknews]] | date = 2007-07-11 | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, IGN revealed the wireless Les Paul controller, which features a removable neck for travel purposes. Additionally, new gameplay videos and screenshots were revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://media.xbox360.ign.com/media/899/899096/vids_1.html | title = ''Guitar Hero III'' Trailer, Videos and Movies | publisher = [[IGN]] | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' introduced three new characters modeled after real-life musicians. [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] is one of the &quot;bosses&quot; and an unlockable playable character in the game. Slash did motion capture with [[RedOctane]] to record his movements for the game, and by beating him in a one-on-one competition (playing an original composition of his), he will be unlocked as a playable character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-24|url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/237807|title=Free Guitar Hero clone really rocks |publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=2007-07-21|author=Saltzman, Marc }}&lt;/ref&gt; The master track of &quot;[[Welcome to the Jungle]]&quot; appears as an encore song which is playable with Slash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-05|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/musicnightlife/2004097352_slash01.html|title=C'mon Slash: Just how good are you at &quot;Guitar Hero&quot;? |publisher=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=2008-01-02|author=Johnson, Brent }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Tom Morello]] is a boss and unlockable character within the game. [[Bret Michaels]] appears as non-playable vocalist for certain songs, providing his voice for these master tracks.

A demo of ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' appeared in ''[[Tony Hawk's Proving Ground]]'' for the Xbox 360, as well as being available as both a [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] download&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-24|url=http://old.gameplanet.co.nz/mag.dyn/News/12085.html|title=Early GHIII demo with Tony Hawk's Proving Ground |publisher=[[Gameplanet]]|date=2007-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an ISO image that could be created through a PC to use on the Xbox 360.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/49515 | title = ''Guitar Hero 3'' Xbox 360 Demo | publisher = [[Shacknews]] | first = Nick | last = Breckon | date = 2007-10-19 | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The demo features five songs (&quot;[[Hello Master|Lay Down]]&quot;, &quot;[[Rock You Like a Hurricane]]&quot;, &quot;[[Even Flow]]&quot;, &quot;[[Hit Me with Your Best Shot]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The Metal]]&quot;) played within the Desert Rock Tour venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = ''Guitar Hero(TM) III: Legends of Rock'' Demo to Debut on ''Tony Hawk&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Proving Ground'' | publisher = [[Activision]] | date = 2008-08-23 | url = http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/guitar-herotm-iii-legends-of-rock-demo-to-debut-on-tony-hawks-proving-ground | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[September 11]], [[2007]], [[Aspyr Media]] and Activision announced that ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' will be developed for both the PC and Macintosh platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/news/guitar-hero-iii-shocker-coming-to-pc-and-mac/17972/?biz=1 | title = ''Guitar Hero III'' Shocker...

However, [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] users with the [[Xbox 360 accessories#Wireless Gaming Receiver|Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows]] will be able to use the Xbox 360 Gibson Les Paul wireless guitar controller as well, though this is not supported by Aspyr Media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/49827 | title = Wireless 360 ''Guitar Hero III'' Controller Compatible with PC Version | publisher = [[Shacknews]] | first = Carlos | last = Bergfeld | date = [[2007-11-07]] | accessdate = 2008-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical issues===
[[1UP.com]] reported that none of the versions allow players to play offline Co-Op Quickplay mode, a feature which was included in ''Guitar Hero II''.  However, a patch is currently available for download at Gamespot.com for the PC version of Guitar Hero III:Legends of Rock.  This patch features updates on graphics, the whammy bar, and various freezes and lags.  Instead, Co-Op mode is only available in &quot;Co-Op Career&quot; Mode, which uses a different setlist from the main career and therefore does not provide Co-Op multiplayer for the entire soundtrack. Co-Op quickplay mode was added to the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 versions via a patch. No further information has been given regarding similar treatment on the Wii and PlayStation 2, so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-24|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3164008|title=Guitar Hero III Patch Adding New Offline Mode |publisher=[[1UP.com]]|date=2007-10-26|author=Klepek, Patrick }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GameSpy had some technical issues with the PlayStation 3's controllers and online matchmaking, noting &quot;...[the included USB dongle] functions on 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz wireless, rather than the console's built-in Bluetooth. You won't be able to use the PlayStation button on the guitar to turn on your console; instead, you'll have to use a Sixaxis or physically turn it on... The Les Pauls will power down after a period of disuse&amp;nbsp;... online multiplayer for PS3 is fairly incompetent in presentation... As of the time we're reviewing this, the PS3 Quick Match option is completely broken.&quot;&lt;ref name='gamespyreview' /&gt;

Though the Wii version of the game was advertised as supporting [[Dolby Pro Logic II]], users have reported that the game outputs in neither Pro Logic II nor [[stereophonic sound|stereo]], providing only [[monaural|mono]] sound. Activision now offers a free replacement remastered game disk that corrects this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.activisiongameexchange.com | title = ''Guitar Hero III'' Wii Replacement Disc Registration Website | publisher = [[Activision]] | accessdate = 2008-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Activision later expanded this offer to include those living in the UK and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.activisiongameexchange.eu | title = ''Guitar Hero III'' Wii Replacement Disc Registration Website (UK &amp; Europe) | publisher = [[Activision]] | accessdate = 2008-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[February 22]], [[2008]], Activision extended the replacement program to include a full refund of the game's purchase price as an alternative to getting a replacement disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.activisiongameexchange.com/%5COtherOffers.aspx | title = ''Guitar Hero III'' Wii Refund | publisher = [[Activision]] | accessdate = 2008-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A class-action lawsuit over the mono sound issue was settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.wired.com/games/2008/04/mono-guitar-her.html | title = Wii Guitar Hero Class Action Settled | publisher = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | first =  Earnest | last = Cavalli | date = [[2008-04-07]] | accessdate = 2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players attempting to upload their scores to the official ''Guitar Hero'' website have also experienced difficulties. According to Neversoft, &quot;the launch of ''Guitar Hero III'' has produced heavy amounts of traffic to the website, and this traffic has caused a number of users to have problems with linking their accounts and uploading scores. We are well aware of these issues, and we are working as fast as we can to fix both problems.&quot;

The PC version has been criticized for having very high system requirements, but still suffering from lag and slowdowns, even on high-end systems with the graphics tuned down to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock/834647p1.html | title = GameSpy: ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' Review | date = [[2007-12-01]] | publisher = [[GameSpy]] | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
{{main|List of songs in Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock}}
''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' features 73 playable songs - 42 are &quot;main setlist&quot; songs, 6 are exclusive to co-op career mode, and the remaining 25 are &quot;bonus tracks&quot;. In total, 54 of the game's songs are master recordings (the highest total of any ''Guitar Hero'' release). In addition, the career mode includes three guitar battles: one each against [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], [[Tom Morello]], and Lou (The Devil). Slash and Morello both wrote and recorded original battle music for the game. Guitarist [[Steve Ouimette]] plays as the Devil for the final battle, and he re-recorded a [[heavy metal music|metal]] guitar version of &quot;[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia]]&quot; for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-04|url=http://media.www.beaconnewspaper.com/media/storage/paper540/news/2007/11/05/Life/Review.Guitar.Hero.Iiilegends.Of.Rock.game-3078686.shtml|title=Review: Guitar Hero III:Legends of Rock (Game) |publisher=[[The Beacon]]|date=2007-11-05|author=Zeng, Eddie }}{{Dead link|url=http://media.www.beaconnewspaper.com/media/storage/paper540/news/2007/11/05/Life/Review.Guitar.Hero.Iiilegends.Of.Rock.game-3078686.shtml|date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- CAUTION - as the inclusion of what example songs there are in Gh3 is going to invoke a lot of POV, the list given below is taken directly from the Activiation press release announcing GH3 - effectively the most non-biased source for these songs. The Sex Pistols is added because of the specificity of the re-recording for GH3. DO NOT ADD ANY MORE EXAMPLES, that's what the &quot;main&quot; template above is doing --&gt;
The soundtrack features such songs as &quot;[[Paint It, Black]]&quot; by [[The Rolling Stones]], &quot;[[Cherub Rock]]&quot; by [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], &quot;[[Sabotage (song)|Sabotage]]&quot; by [[Beastie Boys]], &quot;[[The Metal]]&quot; by [[Tenacious D]], &quot;[[My Name is Jonas]]&quot; by [[Weezer]], &quot;[[Knights of Cydonia]]&quot; by [[Muse (band)|Muse]], &quot;[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]&quot; by [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], &quot;[[School's Out (song)|School's Out]]&quot; by [[Alice Cooper]], &quot;[[Slow Ride]]&quot; by [[Foghat]], &quot;[[One (Metallica song)|One]]&quot; by [[Metallica]], and &quot;[[Barracuda (song)|Barracuda]]&quot; by [[Heart (band)|Heart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://investor.activision.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=245046 | date = [[2007-05-23]] | accessdate = 2008-07-24 | publisher = [[Activision]] | title = Activision Shreds New Details on Next ''Guitar Hero(TM)'' Game }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also features re-recordings of &quot;[[Anarchy in the U.K.]]&quot; by [[Sex Pistols]] and &quot;[[Cult of Personality (song)|Cult of Personality]]&quot; by [[Living Colour]] specifically for ''Guitar Hero III'', as the original master tracks could not be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spin.com/articles/sex-pistols-re-record-anarchy-guitar-hero-grohl-zeppelins-beck-and-call | title = Sex Pistols Re-Record &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;Anarchy&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; for ''Guitar Hero''; Grohl at Zeppelin's &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;Beck and Call&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; | date = [[2007-09-26]] | accessdate = 2008-07-24 | publisher = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This game is the first in the series to feature a bonus track (&quot;[[She Bangs the Drums]]&quot;) that is not an original recording.

Xbox 360 players who purchase the compact disc soundtrack (which contains select tracks from the game) will have access to a code that can be redeemed for 3 exclusive playable tracks on [[Xbox Live Marketplace]].&lt;ref name='soundtrack'&gt;{{cite web | title=More Than A Video Game Soundtrack | date=2007-11-01 | publisher=[[Activision]] | url =http://community.guitarhero.com/accounts/login | accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The same information can also be found on http://www.interscope.com/guitarheroiiiexpansionsoundtrack --&gt;

''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' also supports future downloadable tracks. Since the game's release, several free and for-cost downloadable songs and song packs have been made available on both [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] and [[PlayStation Store]].&lt;ref name=&quot;xbox-360-dlc-support&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://games.ign.com/articles/831/831038p1.html | title = Activision Gets Ready to Shred Store Shelves | date = [[2007-10-26]] | publisher = [[IGN]] | last = Dunham | first = Alexis | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Wii version can be used to play against others online, the game does not have the functionality of downloading new content, due to limitations with the internal memory storage of the system, an issue that will be overcome for the release of ''Guitar Hero World Tour''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/52908 | title = Guitar Hero 4 Wii DLC Includes Actual New Songs, Developer Explains GH3 Wii's Lack of DLC | date = [[2008-05-29]] | accessdate = 2008-05-29 | first = Chris | last = Faylor | publisher = [[Shacknews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activision has called ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' its &quot;largest product launch ever&quot;, selling over [[US$]]100 million in the first week after release in [[North America]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edge-online.com/news/guitar-hero-leads-activisions-record-q2 | title = ''Guitar Hero'' Leads Activision's Record Q2 | publisher = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = [[2007-11-05]] | accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Activision reported concerns of being unable to meet the demand for the game for the 2007 holiday season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edge-online.com/news/guitar-hero-iii-may-fall-short-demand | title = ''Guitar Hero III'' May Fall Short of Demand | publisher = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = [[2007-11-05]] | accessdate = 2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game was the highest selling video game of 2007, in terms of units sold and revenue earned.&lt;ref name=&quot;gt-sales&quot; /&gt;  As of [[July 15]], [[2008]], the game has sold more than 8 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUKN1245149420080713 | title = RedOctane execs on a roll with &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; | publisher = [[Reuters]] | first = Antony | last = Bruno | date = [[2008-07-13]] | accessdate = 2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[NPD Group]], [[GfK]] [[Chart-Track]], and [[Enterbrain]], the game has sold 3.037 million units in the United States, 412,000 in the United Kingdom, and 26,000 million in Japan, respectively, for a total of 3.475 million units during the first half of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Leading Market Research Firms Join Forces to Provide First Multi-Continent View Of Video Game Software Sales |url=http://www.npd.com/press/releases/press_080821.html |date=2008-08-21 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |publisher=[[NPD Group]], [[GfK]] [[Chart-Track]], [[Enterbrain]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On average, ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' received strong review scores, although it generally scored lower than its predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.org/search/process?sort=relevance&amp;termType=all&amp;ts=guitar+hero&amp;ty=0&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 | title = Search Results on Metacritic - ''Guitar Hero'' | publisher = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = 2008-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the October issue of ''[[Game Informer]]'', the magazine gave a full review of ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' a month before the game's release. It rated the game a 8.75/10, with a 9.0/10 as a second opinion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2007 |month=October |title=''Guitar Hero III'' review|journal=[[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' awarded it an 8/10. The game was praised for its graphics and fun, addictive gameplay that was the staple of the ''Guitar Hero'' series. [[IGN]] also scored the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions an 8.9/10, while [[GameSpot]] gave the game a 8/10 score. In addition, the [[Gibson Les Paul]] controller included with bundled version of the game received particular praise; [[GameSpy]], in a five page review of all four console versions, praised, &quot;''GH3''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s new Les Paul model kicks ass in every way imaginable. It's wireless, the shape feels more comfortable, and the fret buttons and strum bar are as smooth as butter.&quot; The same review also called the Wii guitar the best of the guitar peripherals, praising the vibration option.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespyreview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/guitar-hero-iii/831299p1.html|title=GameSpy ''Guitar Hero III''' review|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=2007-10-29|accessdate=2008-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most critics have also praised the soundtrack for its song selection and quantity of master tracks.

The game has also been subject to criticisms. For example, IGN's review of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions noted, &quot;…there's not really a whole lot new here. We understand that this was Neversoft's first take at the franchise, but it's a pretty safe effort as the basic formula remains exactly the same.&quot; The review also criticized the lack of customizable rockers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/830/830837p1.html?RSSwhen2007-10-28_090000&amp;RSSid=830837|publisher=[[IGN]]|title=IGN ''Guitar Hero III'' review|first=Erik|last=Brudvig|date=2007-10-28|accessdate=2008-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN's review of the Wii version noted the game's presentation and art direction feeling &quot;forced&quot; and, as a result, less visually appealing than previous installments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://uk.wii.ign.com/articles/831/831151p2.html | title = ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' (Wii) Review | publisher = [[IGN]] | author = Bozon | date = 2007-10-29 | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''GameDaily'' stated, &quot;While playing through the songs — one question stayed at the forefront of our minds — what's up with the white boy soundtrack? We would have liked to see more from legends like [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] in the mix.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamedaily.com/games/guitar-hero-iii-legends-of-rock/xbox-360/game-reviews/item/5994/1826/ | title = GameDaily ''Guitar Hero III'' review|publisher=[[GameDaily]] | author = Chris Buffa | date = 2007-10-28 | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GameSpy criticized some of the tweaks, stating, &quot;the Star Power phrases tend to be so long, if you have enough skill to get them you can beat the song anyway&quot;&amp;nbsp;... &quot;the sequences are a little too much of a trial-by-fire compared to past ''Guitar Hero'' games. From the first tier, Medium simply feels like Hard-minus-the-orange-button.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespyreview&quot;/&gt; GameSpot criticized the &quot;heavy dose of [[in-game advertising]]&quot; in its reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/puzzle/guitarheroiii/review.html?tag=review;ps2 | title = GameSpot ''Guitar Hero III'' review (PlayStation 2) | publisher=[[GameSpot]]|last = Navarro | first = Alex | authorlink = Alex Navarro | date = 2007-10-29 | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GameSpy stated that the PlayStation 2 version got &quot;the short end of the stick&quot; due to a lack of online play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/guitar-hero-iii/834141p1.html | title = GameSpy ''Guitar Hero III'' review (PlayStation 2) |publisher=[[GameSpy]] | date = 2007-11-09 | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' has also criticized the game for being, &quot;...too competitive and not in the spirit of the previous two installments.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;oxm&quot; /&gt;

{{anchor|Chris Chike}}
[[Guinness World Records]] has created a category for the &quot;Highest Score for a Single Song on Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot; as part of its Gamers edition based on the song &quot;[[Through the Fire and Flames]].&quot;  This record was previously held by Chris Chike, who also won the 2008 Play N Trade National Guitar Hero III Tournament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chris Chike, world record holder, wins Play N Trade National Guitar Hero III™ tournament|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2008_March_19/ai_n24928493|publisher=[[Business Wire]]|date=2008-03-19|accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the current record holder is Daniel Johnson as of [[May 23]], [[2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=142796 | title = Guitar Hero III world record broken | first = Tom | last = Bradwell | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] | date = [[2008-05-23]] | accessdate = 2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chike would later defeat Johnson's record by hitting 100% of the song's notes and scoring 987,786 points in the process.  However, there was no Guinness official present to certify the record, only a YouTube video uploaded by Chike on [[June 3]], [[2008]], leaving Johnson as the official record-holder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5GpRJItqjw &quot;Through the Fire and Flames TTFAF FC 100% 987,786.&quot;]  ''[[YouTube.com]]''.

'''Matchbox Twenty''' (or '''MB20''', '''MBT''', '''M20''', originally spelled '''Matchbox 20''') is a [[rock band]] formed in [[Orlando, Florida]]. 

Matchbox Twenty has sold over 44 million albums worldwide from the releases of ''[[Yourself or Someone Like You]]'', ''[[Mad Season (album)|Mad Season]]'', and ''[[More Than You Think You Are]].'' They released their latest album, ''[[Exile on Mainstream]]'', on [[October 2]], [[2007]]. The current members of the band are [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]], [[Paul Doucette]], [[Brian Yale]], and [[Kyle Cook]]. Rhythm guitarist [[Adam Gaynor]] left the band in 2005, after performing on their first three studio albums. Rob Thomas is the principal songwriter and lead singer. Rob Thomas has created a well-established solo career for himself after releasing the album, ''[[…Something to Be]]''. 

==History==
Rob Thomas, Brian Yale, and Paul Doucette performed in the band [[Tabitha's Secret]] which originated in [[Orlando, Florida]], with fellow members John Stanley and John Goff, before splitting to start a new band (what was to become Matchbox Twenty). After recruiting the talents of Adam Gaynor from [[Criteria Studios|Criteria Recording Studios]] in Miami and Kyle Cook from the Atlanta Institute of Music, the lineup was complete and ready to begin. 

===''Yourself or Someone Like You'' (1997-2000)===
{{main|Yourself or Someone Like You}}
Matchbox Twenty released their debut album, ''[[Yourself or Someone Like You]]'', in 1996. While their first single, &quot;[[Long Day]]&quot;, was a rock radio-only smash, the album soon spun off several Top 40 hit singles throughout 1997 and 1998, including &quot;[[Push (song)|Push]]&quot;, &quot;[[3 A.M.]]&quot;, &quot;[[Real World (song)|Real World]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Back 2 Good]]&quot;. The album eventually went on to sell over 12 million copies in the U.S. alone, earning [[diamond album|diamond]] status. The band toured relentlessly for several years, performing from the album, along with some cover songs such as [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s &quot;[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]&quot; and [[The Beatles]]' &quot;[[Don't Let Me Down (The Beatles song)|Don't Let Me Down]]&quot;. Their fan base grew from concert to concert based on their electrifying live performances and the longevity of their hit singles on radio. That same year, Matchbox Twenty recorded a live version of their Top-40 hit &quot;3 A.M.&quot; for release on the charity album ''[[Live in the X Lounge]]'', benefiting [[cerebral palsy]] research. 

Before recording their second album, Rob Thomas collaborated with Itaal Shur on a song called &quot;Smooth&quot; for Carlos Santana's comeback album, ''[[Supernatural (album)|Supernatural]]''. The song had a pop-tinged Latin beat and showcased Thomas' lyrical talents. Thomas was supposed to act solely as songwriter on &quot;Smooth&quot;, but Carlos Santana had him sing on it as well after hearing the song's demo recording. &quot;[[Smooth (song)|Smooth]]&quot; was the album's lead single and became a hit in 1999; Thomas earned three [[Grammy Award|Grammys]] for writing and performing on &quot;[[Smooth (song)|Smooth]]&quot;, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.

===''Mad Season'' (2000-2002)===
{{main|Mad Season (album)}}
In 2000, Matchbox 20 renamed themselves Matchbox Twenty and released their second album, ''Mad Season''. The album featured lush instrumental arrangements, and spun off several hit singles, including &quot;Bent&quot; (which went #1 on the Hot 100) and &quot;If You're Gone&quot;. The [[music video|video]] for &quot;[[Bent (song)|Bent]]&quot; poked fun of singer Thomas' heightened profile from &quot;Smooth&quot; by showing the other band members assaulting him mercilessly. The evocatively arranged ballad &quot;[[If You're Gone]]&quot; became a big hit, especially on [[adult contemporary]] formats. The band's next two singles, &quot;[[Mad Season (song)|Mad Season]]&quot; and &quot;[[Last Beautiful Girl]]&quot; were not as successful.

===''More Than You Think You Are'' and band hiatus (2002-2007)===
{{main|More Than You Think You Are}}
For their third album, ''More Than You Think You Are'', the band returned to a harder rock sound.  Thomas shared the songwriting efforts with the other band members on several songs. The album contained hit singles &quot;[[Disease (song)|Disease]]&quot;, &quot;[[Unwell]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Bright Lights (song)|Bright Lights]]&quot;. Although it was not as commercially successful as the band's two earlier efforts, it had an enormous radio presence for well over a year, and received a large amount of critical praise.

In 2003 the band released a small album including only six songs, ''[[EP (album)|EP]]''. The album had never before released live and acoustic versions of former songs like &quot;[[Push]]&quot; and &quot;[[If You're Gone]]&quot;, and also a new track, &quot;Suffer Me&quot;. The albums were mostly intended as a special little treat for the fans and to get popular versions of songs available. 

In May 2004, the band released a live concert [[DVD]], ''Show: A Night in the Life of Matchbox Twenty'', filmed in Atlanta and featuring 20 songs, including all of their hit singles.

In February 2005, rhythm guitarist Gaynor officially left the group, which had been on hiatus to allow other members to pursue side projects. Rob Thomas went on to release a solo album, ''[[…Something to Be]]'', which became the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Billboard 200]] #1 album the first week of its release. The album featured four hit singles: &quot;[[Lonely No More]]&quot;, &quot;[[This Is How a Heart Breaks]]&quot;, &quot;[[Ever the Same]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Streetcorner Symphony]]&quot;. 

In January 2007, Rob Thomas released a single, &quot;[[Little Wonders]]&quot;, which he wrote for the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] movie ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]''.

===''Exile on Mainstream'' and the future (2007-present)===
{{main|Exile on Mainstream}}
The group returned to the music scene in 2007, with the release of their 'retrospective' album ''[[Exile on Mainstream]]'' on [[October 2]], [[2007]]. &quot;[[How Far We've Come]]&quot; was the first single off the new album, which also includes five other new songs and a complete collection of all eleven of their previously released singles. The album was also released in the new MVI (Music Video Interactive) format, which includes two video interviews discussing the six new songs and eleven greatest hits, plus extras including a retrospective photo gallery, [[U-MYX]] (to remix &quot;How Far We've Come&quot;), buddy icons, wallpapers, and more. &quot;How Far We've Come&quot; was released on the band's MySpace page in July, with the video release on [[September 6]], [[2007]]. 

Matchbox Twenty toured in early 2008 with special guest [[Alanis Morissette]] and opener [[Mute Math]].  The band began their US tour on [[January 25]], [[2008]], in Hollywood, FL, and concluded in Las Vegas, NV, on [[March 18]], [[2008]] before heading to Australia for the month of April.  Following Australia, Matchbox Twenty visited the UK for the first time in five years to play six concerts in Cardiff, Wembley, Birmingham, Glasgow, and Manchester (which gets the benefit of two shows).  Support was provided by Nottingham band, Headway.
====Next Album====
There are also rumors of a 2009 album that has yet to be named. First, Rob Thomas is expected to spend most of 2008 working on his second solo album.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Cohen, [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003631148 &quot;matchbox twenty Sets 'Mainstream' Track List&quot;], Billboard.com, August 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DTS''' (also known as '''Digital Theater Systems'''), owned by '''DTS, Inc.''' ({{nasdaq|DTSI}}), is a multi-channel digital [[surround sound]] format used for both commercial/theatrical and consumer grade applications.  It is used for in-movie sound both on film and on DVD, and during the last few years of the [[Laserdisc]] format's existence, several releases had DTS soundtracks.

== History ==
One of the company's initial investors was [[film director]] [[Steven Spielberg]], who felt that theatrical sound formats up until the company's founding were no longer state of the art, and as a result were no longer optimal for use on projects where quality sound reproduction was of the utmost importance.  Work on the format started in 1991, four years after [[Dolby Labs]] started work on its new [[codec]], [[Dolby Digital]].  The basic and most common version of the format is a 5.1 channel system, similar to a Dolby Digital setup, which encodes the audio as five primary (full-range) channels plus a special LFE ([[low-frequency effect]]) channel, for the [[subwoofer]].  

Note however that encoders and decoders support numerous channel combinations and stereo, four-channel and four-channel+LFE soundtracks have been released commercially on DVD, CD and Laserdisc. 

Other newer DTS variants are also currently available, including versions that support up to seven primary audio channels plus one LFE channel (DTS-ES).  DTS's main competitors in multichannel theatrical audio are [[Dolby Digital]] and [[SDDS]], although only Dolby Digital and DTS are used on [[DVD]]s and implemented in home theater hardware. Spielberg debuted the format with his 1993 production of ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', which came slightly less than a full year after the official theatrical debut of Dolby Digital (''[[Batman Returns]]'').  In addition, ''Jurassic Park'' also became the first home video release to contain DTS sound when it was released on LaserDisc in January 1997, two years after the first Dolby Digital home video release (''[[Clear and Present Danger (film)|Clear and Present Danger]]'' on Laserdisc) which debuted in January 1995.

[[Image:35mm film audio macro.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A photo of a print featuring all four audio formats (or &quot;quad track&quot;)- from left to right, SDDS (blue area to the left of the holes), Dolby Digital (grey area between the sprocket holes), analog sound (the two white lines to the right of the Dolby Digital track), and the DTS timecode (the dashed line to the right of the analog track.)]]
In theatrical use, information in the form of a modified [[time code]] is optically imaged onto the film. An optical LED reader reads the timecode data off the film and sends it to the DTS processor which uses this timecode to synchronize the projected image with the soundtrack audio. The actual audio is recorded in compressed form on standard [[CD-ROM]] media at a bitrate of 1,103 kbit/s. The processor also acts as a transport mechanism, as it holds and reads the audio discs. Newer units can generally hold three discs, allowing a single processor/transport to handle two-disc film soundtracks along with a third disc containing sound for theatrical trailers. In addition, specific elements of the imprinted timecode allow identifying data to be embedded within the code, ensuring that a certain film's [[soundtrack]] will only run with that film. DTS provided the Digital Audio for [[IMAX]]  until 2001, when [[Dolby]] took over.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

DTS and Dolby Digital (AC-3), DTS's chief competitor in the cinema and home theater market, are often compared due to their similarity in product goals.  In theatrical installations, AC-3 audio is placed between sprocket holes, leaving the audio content susceptible to physical damage due to film wear and mishandling.  DTS audio is stored on a separate set of CD-ROM media, whose greater storage capacity affords the potential to deliver better audio fidelity.  However, the separation of print film and audiotrack is both a blessing and a curse.  AC-3 (and SDDS) reside entirely on the 35 mm film itself, simplifying distribution by eliminating an extra (optional) deliverable.  But DTS's CD-ROM media is not subject to the usual wear and damage suffered by the film print during the normal course of the movie's theatrical screening.  Disregarding the separate CD-ROM assembly as a potential point of failure, the DTS audiopath is comparatively impervious to film degradation, excepting that the film-printed timecode is completely destroyed.

In the consumer (home theater) market, AC-3 and DTS are close in terms of audio performance.  When the DTS audio track is encoded at its highest legal bitrate (1,536&amp;nbsp;kbit/s), technical experts rank DTS as perceptually transparent for most audio program material (i.e., indistinguishable to the uncoded source in a [[double blind]] test.)  Dolby claims its competing AC-3 codec achieves similar transparency at its highest coded bitrate (640&amp;nbsp;kbit/s).  However, in program material available to home consumers (DVD, broadcast and subscription Digital TV), neither AC-3 nor DTS run at its highest allowed bitrate.  DVD and broadcast (ATSC) HDTV cap AC-3 bitrate at 448&amp;nbsp;kbit/s.  But even at 448&amp;nbsp;kbit/s, consumer audio gear already enjoys better audio performance than theatrical (35 mm movie) installations, which are limited to even lower bitrates.  When DTS-audio was introduced to the DVD specification, studios authored DVD-movies at DTS's full bitrate (1,536&amp;nbsp;kbit/s).  Later movie titles were almost always encoded at a reduced bitrate of 768&amp;nbsp;kbit/s, ostensibly to increase the number of audio-tracks on the movie disc.  At this reduced rate (768&amp;nbsp;kbit/s), DTS no longer retains audio transparency.

AC-3 and DTS are sometimes judged by their encoded bitrates.  DTS proponents claim that the extra bits give higher fidelity and more dynamic range, providing a richer and more lifelike sound.  But no conclusion can be drawn from their respective bitrates, as each codec relies on different coding tools and syntax to compress audio.  When the DTS and AC-3 audiotracks on the same DVD are compared, some movies exhibit noticeable differences.  A DTS track is often louder with less hiss, even at the same relative playback volume.&lt;ref&gt;[http://firstdtsstudio.hit.bg/faq_dts_eng.html First DTS Studio, DTS Surround FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==DTS as a codec==

On the consumer level, DTS is the oft-used shorthand for the [[DTS Coherent Acoustics]] codec, transportable through [[S/PDIF]] and used on [[DVD]]s, [[CDDA]]s, [[LD]]s and in wave files. This system is the consumer version of the DTS standard, using a similar [[codec]] without needing separate DTS CD-ROM media.

There are significant technical differences between commercial/theatrical and home variants: the former being a traditional [[ADPCM]] compression system and the latter a sophisticated hybrid perceptual and signal-redundancy compressor based on ADPCM called APTX-100.

A free Codec for DTS &amp; AC3 is available at [http://ac3filter.net/ ac3filter.net]

In 1993, the creators of ''[[LC Concept]]'', an earlier French sound-on-disc format, obtained an injunction preventing Jurassic Park from being played in DTS in France &lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} ''[http://www.lexpansion.com/art/6.0.114890.0.html Les dinosaures muselés par deux français]'', ''L'Expansion'' (October 21, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;.  LC Concept has a number of significant differences from DTS, using a different codec (MUSICAM) and different discs (300 MB magneto-optical).

==DTS playback==
Both music and movie DVDs allow delivery of DTS audio tracks.  But DTS was not part of the original DVD specification (1997), so early DVD players did not recognize DTS audio tracks at all. The DVD specification was revised to allow optional inclusion of DTS audio tracks. The DVD title must carry one or more primary audio tracks in AC-3 or [[Linear pulse code modulation|LPCM]] format (in Europe, MPEG-1 is also an allowed primary track format).  The DTS audio track, if present, can be selected by the user.  Modern DVD players can now decode DTS natively with no problem, or pass it through to an external decoder.  Nearly all standalone receivers and many integrated (&quot;home theater in a box&quot;) DVD player/receivers manufactured today can decode DTS.

For PC playback, many software players support the decoding of DTS. The [[VideoLAN]] project has created a decoding module for DTS called [[libdca]] (formerly libdts), which is the first open source implementation of DTS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.html Videolan features page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sony [[Playstation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] are capable of DTS decoding and output via [[Toslink]] or [[HDMI]] as LPCM. However on the 360, this feature is only found on the Elite model and newer models available since. Only the Playstation 3 console has the ability to decode DTS-HD Master Audio or High Resolution since the newest firmware update, ver. 2.30 and up. The Xbox 360 can only output the core bitstream at 1.5 Mbit/s via LPCM or Toslink.

==DTS variants==

In addition to the standard 5.1 channel DTS Surround codec, the company has several other technologies in its product range designed to compete with similar systems from [[Dolby Labs]]. The primary new technologies are:

===DTS 70 mm===
This is a process designed specifically for playback in motion picture theaters equipped with [[70mm]] projection and 6-track stereophonic surround sound. 70mm DTS prints do not have 6-track magnetic striping, so there is no analog backup should the digital sound fail.  The timecode track on the film is many times wider than the 35mm version, since it can occupy the real estate formerly taken up by a magnetic track.  Theaters with 70mm DTS frequently install two timecode readers for greater reliability.

The gradual disappearance of 70mm as a common exhibition format has led to DTS-70 being reserved for niche engagements of 70mm revivals and restorations.  Dolby Digital has not been adapted to the 70mm.

===DTS-ES===
'''DTS-ES''' (DTS Extended Surround) includes two variants, ''DTS-ES Matrix'' and ''DTS-ES Discrete 6.1'', depending on how the sound was originally mastered and stored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timefordvd.com/ref/dts-ES.shtml DTS Extended Surround at timefordvd.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  DTS-ES Discrete provides 6.1 discrete channels, with a discretely recorded (non-[[Matrix (sound recording)|matrixed]]) center-surround channel; in home theater systems with a 7.1 configuration, the two rear-center speakers play in [[Monaural|mono]].  DTS-ES Matrix provides 5.1 discrete channels with a matrixed center-surround audio channel.  DTS-ES commonly works on a matrix system, whereby processors that are compatible with the ES codec look for and recognize &quot;flags&quot; built into the audio coding and &quot;un-fold&quot; the rear-center sound from data that would otherwise be sent to rear surround speakers.  This is notated as DTS-ES 5.1. Less frequently, DTS-ES data can be encoded with a discrete sixth audio channel (the rear-center), meaning that the audio data for the sixth channel is stored separately from the other information, and is not embedded or matrixed among other channels. This is notated as DTS-ES 6.1, as the center rear is completely discrete from the other channels. ES capable processors can recognize the discrete sixth channel, and play it back if connected to the necessary speaker(s). In contrast, Dolby's competing [[Dolby Digital EX#Dolby Digital EX|EX]] codec, which also boasts a center rear channel, can only handle matrixed data and does not support a discrete sixth channel. DTS-ES is backward compatible with standard DTS setups, so non-ES equipment which does not recognize the flags or with ES enabled equipment that lack the extra speaker connections, sound plays back in 5.1 as if it were standard DTS.  Only a few DVD titles have been released with DTS-ES Discrete.

===DTS NEO:6===
'''DTS NEO:6''', like Dolby's Pro Logic IIx system, can take stereo content and convert the sound into 5.1 or 6.1 channel format.

===DTS 96/24===
'''DTS 96/24''' allows the delivery of 5.1 channels of 24-bit, 96 kHz audio and high quality video on the DVD-Video format.  Prior to the invention of DTS 96/24, it was only possible to deliver two channels of 24-bit, 96 kHz audio on DVD-Video.  DTS 96/24 can also be placed in the video zone on [[DVD-Audio]] discs, making these discs playable on all DTS compatible DVD players.

===DTS-HD High Resolution Audio===
'''DTS-HD High Resolution Audio''', like DTS-HD Master Audio, is an extension to the original DTS audio format. It delivers up to 7.1 channels of sound at 96 kHz sampling frequency and 24 bit depth resolution. DTS-HD High Resolution Audio is selected as an optional surround sound format for Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD with constant bit rates up to respectively 6.0 Mbit/s and 3.0 Mbit/s. It is supposed to be an alternative for DTS-HD Master Audio where disc space may not allow it.

===DTS-HD Master Audio===
[[Image:DTS-HD-MA.svg|180px|thumb|right|DTS-HD Master Audio logo]]
{{main|DTS-HD Master Audio}}
'''DTS-HD Master Audio''', previously known as ''DTS++'' and ''DTS-HD'', supports a virtually unlimited number of surround sound channels, can [[downmixing|downmix]] to 5.1 and two-channel, and can deliver audio quality at bit rates extending from DTS Digital Surround up to lossless (24-bit, 192 kHz).  
DTS-HD Master Audio is selected as an optional surround sound format for [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and [[HD DVD]], where it has been limited to a maximum of 8 discrete channels.  DTS-HD MA supports variable bit rates up to 24.5 Mbit/s on a Blu-ray Disc and up to 18.0 Mbit/s for HD-DVD, with 6 channel encoded at up to 192 kHz or 8 channels encoded at 96 kHz/24 bit. In case more than 6 channels are used, a &quot;Channel Remapping&quot; function allows for remixing the soundtrack to compensate for a different channel layout in the playback system compared to the original mix.
Currently the Japanese version Pioneer BDP-LX80 supports bitstream digital output of the format along with the Samsung BD-P1400 (through a firmware update). All Blu-ray and HD DVD players can decode the DTS &quot;core&quot; resolution soundtrack at 1.5 Mbit/s, however. DTS-HD Master Audio and [[Dolby TrueHD]] are the only technologies that deliver compressed lossless surround sound for these new disc formats, ensuring the highest quality audio performance available in the new standards. (N.B.: DTS Coherent Acoustics coding system has been selected as mandatory audio technology for both the Blu-ray Disc (BD) and High Definition Digital Versatile Disc (HD DVD).&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.dts.com/company/press/press-article.php?ID=132784259&amp;yID=2004&amp;cID=1 ''DTS technology mandatory for next generation discs'' – dts.com]&lt;/ref&gt;)

=== DTS Connect ===
'''DTS Connect''' is a blanket name for a two part system used on the computer platform only, in order to convert PC audio into the DTS format, which is transported via a single S/PDIF cable&lt;ref&gt; ''[http://www.dts.com/Corporate/Press_Room/Press_Releases/2008/02/LEADING_MOTHERBOARD_COMPANY_FOXCONN_TEAMS_WITH_AUDIO_PIONEER_DTSFOR_INTEGRATED_PC_PRODUCTS.aspx LEADING MOTHERBOARD COMPANY, FOXCONN, TEAMS WITH AUDIO PIONEER DTS FOR INTEGRATED PC PRODUCTS]'', February 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;. The two components of the system are DTS Interactive and DTS Neo:PC. It is found on soundcards with CMedia CMI8788/CMI8770 Soundcontroller and onboard audio with Realtek ALC883DTS/ALC889A/ALC888DD-GR and SoundMAX AD1988 chip.

* '''DTS Interactive''': This is a realtime DTS stream encoder. On the PC it takes multi-channel audio and converts it into a 1.5mpbs DTS stream for ouput. Also it can be found on some stand alone devices (e.g., Surround Encoder).  Nearly a dozen titles on the [[PlayStation 2]] feature the &quot;DTS Interactive&quot; realtime stream encoder, such as ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', and ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (video game)|Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]''

* '''DTS Neo:PC''': Is a technology that is based on the [[#DTS NEO:6| DTS Neo:6]] matrix surround technology, which transforms any stereo content (MP3, WMA, CD Audio, or games) into a simulated 7.1-channel surround sound experience. The 7.1-channel surround sound is output as a DTS stream for output via a [[S/PDIF]] cable part.

=== Others ===
* '''DTS Surround Sensation''': A relatively new development, previously known as DTS Virtual.  It allows a virtual 5.1 surround sound to be heard through a standard pair of headphones.&lt;ref&gt; ''[http://www.dtsonline.com/company/press/press-article.php?ID=703729023&amp;yID=2008&amp;cID=0 DTS Press Release New Simulated Surround Headphone / Speaker Solutions Meet Consumer Demand]'',  (January 7, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of [[Education in the United States|education]] in the [[United States]], [[secondary education]] usually covers [[Educational stages|grades]] 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 through 12.

==Historical Impact of Secondary Education in the United States==
During the 20th century, the economic demand of labor with secondary education skills rose due to the rise of big businesses, advances in science and technology and large-scale retailing that led to the increase of returns of education. &lt;ref&gt;The Human-Capital Century and American Leadership:Virtues of the Past by Claudia Goldin&lt;/ref&gt; However, the quality of education present in the inner cities has consistently lagged behind that of the average level. {{Fact|date=May 2008}}

==Teaching secondary==
Teachers are certified in one of two areas for secondary education:  middle school or high school.  These certifications can overlap.  In [[Missouri]], for example, middle school certification covers grades 6-8, elementary school certification covers up to grade 5, and high school certification covers grades 9-12.   This reflects the wide range of grade combinations of middle schools, Junior Highs, and elementary schools.  Alternatively, some states certify teachers in various curricular areas (such as math or history) to teach secondary education.

==Middle schools (Grades 6/7/8 through 8/9) and Junior High schools==
{{main|Middle school}}
[[Middle school]]s (Still commonly called by the older names &quot;junior high school&quot; and &quot;intermediate school&quot;) are schools that span grades 6 through 8. Schools that span grades 7 through 9 typically are referred to as junior high schools . Both are between [[primary education]]/[[elementary education]] and [[high school]]. Missouri issues its wide ranging and overlapping certification because many school districts, especially around Saint Louis, are historically and currently divided into Elementary, Middle School,  Junior High, and High School.  In these districts  Middle Schools range  grades 5-6th (in some cases 4th grade is included),  with Junior High running 7-8th, and in some cases 9th , grades.  More rural districts offer an all-inclusive elementary school K-6.  Some very poor rural districts only have one school building in the district, as that is all the district can afford to build and operate, serving K-12.   In Missouri this is possible because the Missouri certification for elementary school allows teachers to teach up to 6'th grade, Middle school from 5'th up to 9'th grade, and the High School certification runs 9'th-12'th grades.    The divisions vary widely by state and even by district.  Some districts even mix all inclusive elementary schools teaching K-6, but split other schools in the district into Elementary and Middle schools . The general rule being there is no general rule in the US as states and even districts within the state have quite a bit of control over the divisions.

Upon arrival in Middle and/or Junior High School, students begin to enroll in class schedules where they take classes from several teachers in a given day- quite unlike elementary school, where most classes are with the same teacher (generally excepting art, music, and physical education). The classes are usually a set of four core academic classes ([[English studies|English]] or &quot;[[language arts]],&quot; [[science]], [[mathematics]], and [[history]] or &quot;[[social studies]]&quot;) with two to four other classes, either electives or supplementary or remedial academic classes.

In school districts divided into Middle and Junior High Schools often one of the main differences between the two is elective courses.  Middle schools typically offer only elective courses for physical education, organized group sports, and for music education (voice,music appreciation, or instrumental music courses).  Junior High by contrast often offers 2-4 elective courses, including foreign languages.  The other main difference is that the instructors in Middle Schools work closely together as a team, each working within the same grade level of students but teaching different core curriculum classes, whereas Junior High is set up with each academic department operating independently of each other, and teaching all grades that attend the school.

Some students also start taking a foreign language or advanced math and science classes in middle school, such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], even Asian languages, [[Algebra I]], Earth Science, and other courses for high school credit. [[Physical education]] classes (also called &quot;PE&quot;, Kinesiology, or by the older term, &quot;gym&quot;) are usually mandatory for various periods.

==High school (Grades 9 through 12)==
[[High school]] usually runs either from grades 9-12 or from grades 10-12.  In the early 20th century, America experienced a &quot;[[High school movement]]&quot; as high school enrollment and graduation rates increased steadily.  This change in high school enrollment and graduation rates has been linked with the rise of the [[second industrial revolution]] and the growth of white collar employment.  In the following years, the economic return to a year of education was high as the demand for office clerks and skilled blue-collar workers increased as well.  In high school, students obtain much more control of their education, and may choose even their core classes. The control given to students varies from state to state and school to school. In 2001, the US Department of Education reported that there were 26,407 public high schools and 10,693 private schools in the US, although this figure may be inflated somewhat by the Department's definition of secondary schools as &quot;schools with secondary grades,&quot; which could include junior high schools with 9th and 10th grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/2002130.pdf|publisher=[[National Center for Education Statistics]]|title=Digest of Education Statistics 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century, it was common for high schools to have entrance examinations which restricted entrance to fewer than 5 percent of the population in preparation for college. Most were expected to be ready for a job or family after junior high school. By mid-century, [[Comprehensive high school]]s became common which were designed to give a free education to any student who chose to  stay in school for 12 years to get a diploma with a minimal grade point average. The goal became to minimize the number who exited at the mandatory attendance age, which varies by State between 14 and 18 years of age,  and become considered to be [[drop out]]s, at risk of economic failure. By the 2000s, [[standards-based education]] was embraced in most states and federal education policy with the goal of raising standards. It changed the measurement of success to academic achievement, rather than the completion of 12 years of education. By 2006, two-thirds of students lived in states with effective standards requiring passing tests to insure that all graduates had achieved these standards. Many, however, were concerned that this would roll back advances in high school graduation rates of groups at academic risk. 

===Basic curricular structure===

There is wide variance in curriculum for students in the United States. Unlike their counterparts in other developed nations, many do not begin to specialize into a narrow field of study until their sophomore year of college. Moreover, since the turn of the 20th century many high schools in the United States have offered a choice of vocational or college prep curriculum. Schools that offer vocational programs include a very high level of technical specialization, Eg; auto mechanics or carpentry, with a half-day instruction/approved work program the senior year as the purpose of the program is to prepare students for gainful employment without a college degree. The level of specialization allowed varies depending on both the state and district the school is located in. The [[Association for Career and Technical Education]] is the largest U.S. association dedicated to promoting this type of education. 

A class period is the time allotted for one class session, usually in schools and colleges. A period may vary in time, but is usually 30-90 minutes long.

There is wide variance in the curriculum required each year but many American high schools require that courses in the areas of [[English language|English]], [[science]], [[social science]], and [[mathematics]] be taken by the students every year although other schools merely set the required number of credits and allow the student a great deal of choice as to when the courses will be taken after 10th grade.  

Generally, three science courses are required.  [[Biology]], [[chemistry]], and [[physics]] are standard options.  Other science studies include [[geology]], the [[environmental science|environment]] and [[forensic science|forensics]].  

High school mathematics subjects include topics such as [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[trigonometry]].  Advanced study options can include [[precalculus]], [[calculus]] and [[statistics]], with or without [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] (AP) or [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) accreditation.

English/Language classes are usually required for four years of high school although many schools count journalism, public speaking/debate,  foreign language, literature, drama, and writing (both technical and creative) classes as English/Language classes. 

Required social science classes often include [[World History]], [[History of the United States|U.S. History]] and [[civics]].  Additional study options can include classes in law (constitutional, criminal or international) [[economics]], [[sociology]],  and [[psychology]].

Two years of [[physical education]] (usually referred to as &quot;gym,&quot; &quot;PE&quot; or &quot;Phys-Ed&quot; by students) is commonly required, although some states and school districts require that all students take Physical Education every semester.  

Many states require a &quot;Health&quot; course in which students typically learn [[anatomy]], [[nutrition]], [[first aid]], the basic concepts of [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[birth control]], and how to make clear decisions concerning [[illegal drugs]], [[cigarettes]], and [[alcohol]]. In some places contraception is not allowed to be taught for religious reasons.  In some places, the health and physical education class are combined into one class or are offered in alternate semesters.

In some private schools, such as [[Catholic school]]s, [[theology]] is required before a student graduates.

===Electives===
Public high schools offer a wide variety of elective courses, although the availability of such courses depends upon each particular school's financial situation. Some schools and states require students to earn a few credits of classes considered electives, most commonly [[foreign language]] and [[physical education]].

Common types of electives include:
*[[Visual arts]] ([[drawing]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]], [[photography]])
*[[Performing arts]] ([[choir]], [[drama]], [[concert band|band]], [[orchestra]], [[dance]], [[film]])
*[[Vocational education]] ([[woodworking]], [[metalworking]], [[automobile repair]])
*[[Computer science]]/[[business education]] ([[word processing]], [[programming]], [[graphic design]], [[computer club]], [[Web design]])
*[[Journalism]]/[[publishing]] ([[school newspaper]], [[yearbook]], [[television|television production]])
*[[Foreign language]]s: ([[French language|French]], [[German Language|German]], [[Italian Language|Italian]], and [[Spanish Language|Spanish]] are common;  [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin language|Latin]], and [[American Sign Language]] are less common, though the latter two are gaining increased popularity; however not all states consider sign language a foreign language and can, therefore, hamper students' ability to go to an out-of-state college where they require a foreign language in high school but do not count American Sign Language.)
*[[Family and consumer science]]/[[health]] (&quot;[[home economics]]&quot;; [[nutrition]], [[child development]])

Some American high schools offer [[drivers' education]]. At some schools, a student can take it during school as a regular course for a credit.  At some, however, drivers education courses are only available after school.

===Additional options for gifted/high performing students===
{{main|Gifted education}}

Not all high schools contain the same rigorous [[coursework]] as others.  Most high and middle schools have classes known as &quot;honors&quot; classes for motivated and gifted students, where the quality of education is usually higher and much tougher.  

Some states and cities offer special high schools with examinations to admit only the highest performing students, such as [[Boston Latin School]], or [[San Francisco]]'s [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School]]. Other high schools cater to the arts. Some schools have been set up for students who do not succeed with normal academic standards. Some have even been created for special social groups such as LGBT students who have been said to have special needs.

If funds are available, a high school may provide [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) or [[IB Diploma Programme|International Baccalaureate]] (IB) courses, which are special forms of honors classes.  AP courses are usually taken during the second, third, or fourth years of high school, either as a replacement for a typical third-year course (e.g. taking AP U.S. History as a replacement for standard U.S. History), a refresher of an earlier course (e.g. taking AP Biology in the fourth year after taking Biology as a freshman), or simply as a way to study something interesting during senior year (e.g. AP Comparative Government).  IB courses are oftentaken as part of a larger, overall program (see [[IB Diploma Programme]]).  They sometimes last two years and are typically taken in the final two years of high school. To obtain the IB Diploma, IB courses are taken as a block of seven courses (e.g. a student cannot choose to only take IB chemistry; IB chemistry must be taken as a part of a larger IB curriculum with six other IB courses).

Most postsecondary institutions take AP or IB exam results into consideration in the admissions process.  Because AP and IB courses are supposed to be the equivalent of freshman year college courses, postsecondary institutions may grant unit credit which enables students to graduate early.  Both public schools and private schools in wealthy neighborhoods are able to provide many more AP and IB course options than impoverished inner-city high schools, and this difference is seen as a major cause of the differing outcomes for their graduates.

Also, in states with well-developed community college systems, there are often mechanisms by which gifted students may seek permission from their school district to attend community college courses full-time during the summer, and during weekends and evenings during the school year.  The units earned this way can often be transferred to one's university, and can facilitate early graduation.

=== Graduation examinations ===
{{main|High school graduation examination}}

Under the education reform movement started in the early 1990s by many state legislatures and the federal government, about two-thirds of the nation's public high school students are required to pass a graduation exam, usually at the 10th and higher grade levels, though no new states had adopted a new requirement in 2006, according to the [[Center on Education Policy]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A 'kickback' against graduation exams, USA Today Aug 17, 2006 6D&lt;/ref&gt;. This requirement has been an object of controversy when states have started to withhold diplomas, and the right to attend commencement exercises if a student does not meet the standards set by the state. This movement was inspired by examinations in other nations. However, a key difference is that most other nations use tests to sort students between academic and vocational schools at different levels. Most American high schools are [[comprehensive high school]]s which enroll all students in a local area, regardless of ability or vocational/college track. 

The Business Roundtable has supported the goal of standards-based education to ensure that all students meet one single world-class standard that will insure success in all careers and college. However, education progressives such as [[Gary Orfield]] of [[Harvard University]] and [[Fairtest]], along with advocates of traditional education question whether such a goal is practical or realistic given the wide range of student ability. The fairness of penalizing disadvantaged students, who typically fail at rates 2 to 4 times the rates of the best performing groups, has been called into question by many in the education community.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{otheruses|SAT (disambiguation)}}
The '''SAT Reasoning Test''' (formerly '''Scholastic Aptitude Test''' and '''Scholastic Assessment Test''') is a [[standardized testing|standardized test]] for [[college admission]]s in the [[Education in the United States|United States]]. The SAT is owned, published, and developed by the [[College Board]], a [[non-profit organization]] in the United States, and was once developed, published, and scored by the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS).&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/about/index.html |title=About the College Board |accessmonthday=[[May 29]] |accessyear=[[2007]] |publisher=[[College Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ETS now administers the exam.

The current SAT Reasoning Test is administered in about four hours and costs $45 ($71 International), excluding late fees.&lt;ref name=costs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/sat/calenfees/fees.html |title=SAT Fees: 2008–09 Fees |accessmonthday=[[July 04]] |accessyear=[[2008]] |publisher=[[College Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the SAT's introduction in [[1901]], its name and scoring has changed several times. In 2005, the test was renamed as &quot;SAT Reasoning Test&quot; with possible scores from 600 to 2400 combining test results from three 800-point sections (math, critical reading, and writing), along with other subsections scored separately.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/sat/about/SATI.html |title=Critical Reading,Writing,Math|accessmonthday=[[Nov 14]] |accessyear=[[2007]] |publisher=[[College Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The College Board states that the SAT measures critical thinking skills that are needed for academic success in [[college]]. They state that the SAT assesses how well the test takers analyze and solve problems—skills they learned in school that they will need in college. The SAT is typically taken by [[high school]] [[Eleventh grade|juniors]] and [[Twelfth grade|seniors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/sat/about/SATI.html |title=Official SAT Reasoning Test page |accessmonthday=June |accessyear=[[2007]] |publisher=[[College Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Specifically, the College Board states that use of the SAT in combination with high school grade point average (GPA) provides a better indicator of success in college than high school grades alone, as measured by college freshman [[Grade (education)|GPA]]. Various studies conducted over the lifetime of the SAT show a statistically significant increase in [[correlation]] of high school grades and freshman grades when the SAT is factored in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/research/pdf/rn10_10755.pdf 01-249.RD.ResNoteRN-10 rv.1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are substantial differences in funding, curricula, grading, and difficulty among U.S. secondary schools due to American [[federalism]], local control, and the prevalence of private, distance, and [[Homeschooling|home schooled]] students. [[ACT (examination)|ACT]]/SAT scores are intended to supplement the secondary school record and help admission officers put local data&amp;mdash;such as course work, grades, and class rank&amp;mdash;in a national perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Korbin, L. (2006). SAT Program Handbook. A Comprehensive Guide to the SAT Program for School Counselors and Admissions Officers, 1, 33+. Retrieved January 24, 2006, from College Board Preparation Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the SAT has been more popular among colleges in the coasts and the ACT more popular in the Midwest and South. There are some colleges that require the ACT to be taken for college course placement, and a few schools that do not accept the SAT at all. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howtogetin.com/CollegePrep/standtest.asp Preparing for College | College Admissions Help at How to Get into College&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
SAT consists of three major sections: Critical [[Reading]], [[Mathematics]], and [[Writing]]. Each section receives a score on the scale of 200&amp;ndash;800. All scores are multiples of 10. Total scores are calculated by adding up scores of the three sections. Each major section is divided into three parts. There are 10 sub-sections, including an additional 25-minute experimental or &quot;equating&quot; section that may be in any of the three major sections. The experimental section is used to [[Norm-referenced test|normalize]] questions for future administrations of the SAT and does not count toward the final score. The test contains 3 hours and 45 minutes of actual timed sections,&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/sat/about/sat/FAQ.html |title=SAT FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions |accessmonthday=[[May 29]] |accessyear=[[2007]] |publisher=[[College Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although most administrations, including orientation, distribution of materials, and completion of the biographical sections, run about 4 hours (10&amp;ndash;25 minutes per sub-section) long.

===Critical Reading===
The Critical Reading, formerly verbal, section of the SAT is made up of three scored sections, two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, with varying types of questions, including sentence completions and questions about short and long reading passages. Critical Reading sections normally begin with 5 to 8 sentence completion questions; the remainder of the questions are focused on the reading passages. Sentence completions generally test the student's [[vocabulary]] and understanding of sentence structure and organization by requiring the student to select one or two words that best complete a given sentence. The bulk of the Critical Reading questions is made up of questions regarding reading passages, in which students read short excerpts on social sciences, humanities, physical sciences, or personal narratives and answer questions based on the passage. Certain sections contain passages asking the student to compare two related passages; generally, these consist of short reading passages as well as longer passages. Since this is a timed test, the number of questions about each passage is proportional to the length of the passage.

===Mathematics===
The [[Mathematics]] section of SAT is widely known as Quantitative Section. Mathematics section consists of three scored sections. There are two 25-minute sections and one 20-minute section, as follows:
* One of the 25-minute sections is entirely multiple choice, with 20 questions.
* The other 25-minute section contains 8 multiple choice questions and 10 grid-in questions.
* The shorter section is all multiple choice, with only 16 questions.
Notably, the SAT has done away with [[quantitative comparison]] questions on the math section, leaving only questions with straightforward [[symbol]]ic or [[Number|numerical]] answers. Since the quantitative comparison questions were well-known for their deceptive nature&amp;mdash;often turning on the student's recognition of a single exception to a rule or pattern&amp;mdash;this choice has been equated to a philosophical shift away from &quot;trickery&quot; and toward &quot;straight math&quot; on the SAT. Also, many test experts have attributed this change, like the addition of the new writing section, to an attempt to make the SAT more like the [[ACT (examination)|ACT]]. Indeed, there is a correlation between ACT scores and SAT scores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://admissionchances.com/college_graph.php?college_names=144&amp;status=applied&amp;yog=All&amp;y=5&amp;x=3&amp;u=&amp;submit=View+College+Stats Scatterplots of Harvard ACT and SAT as a crude example]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://admissionchances.com/college_graph.php?college_names=405&amp;status=applied&amp;yog=All&amp;y=5&amp;x=1&amp;u=&amp;submit=View+College+Stats Scatterplots of Berkley ACT and SAT as a crude example]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
The writing section of the SAT, based on but not directly comparable to the old SAT II subject test in writing, includes multiple choice questions and a brief essay. The multiple choice questions include error identification questions, sentence improvement questions, and paragraph improvement questions. Error identification and sentence improvement questions test the student's knowledge of grammar, presenting an awkward or grammatically incorrect sentence; in the error identification section, the student must locate the word producing the source of the error or indicate that the sentence has no error, while the sentence improvement section requires the student to select an acceptable fix to the awkward sentence. The paragraph improvement questions test the student's understanding of logical organization of ideas, presenting a poorly written student essay and asking a series of questions as to what changes might be made to best improve it.

The essay section, which is always administered as the first section of the test, is 25 minutes long. All essays must be in response to a given prompt. The prompts are broad and often philosophical and are designed to be accessible to students regardless of their educational and social backgrounds. For instance, test takers may be asked to expound on such ideas as their opinion on the value of work in human life or whether technological change also carries negative consequences to those who benefit from it. No particular essay structure is required, and the College Board accepts examples &quot;taken from [the student's] reading, studies, experience, or observations.&quot; Two trained readers assign each essay a score between 1 and 6, where a score of 0 is reserved for essays that are blank, off-topic, non-English, not written with a Number 2 pencil, or considered illegible after several attempts at reading. The scores are summed to produce a final score from 2 to 12 (or 0). If the two readers' scores differ by more than one point, then a senior third reader decides. The essay score accounts for roughly 30% of the writing score; the multiple choice component accounts for roughly 70%.

===Questions===
Most of the questions on the SAT are [[multiple choice]]; all multiple-choice questions have five answer choices, one of which is correct. The questions of each section of the same type are generally ordered by difficulty. However, an important exception exists: Questions that follow the long and short reading passages are organized chronologically, rather than by difficulty. Ten of the questions in one of the math sub-sections are not multiple choice. They instead require the test taker to bubble in a number in a four-column grid. 

The questions are weighted equally. For each correct answer, one raw point is added. For each incorrect answer one-fourth of a point is deducted. No points are deducted for incorrect math grid-in questions. This ensures that a student's [[Expected value|mathematically expected gain]] from guessing is zero. The final score is derived from the raw score; the precise conversion chart varies between test administrations.

The SAT therefore recommends only making educated guesses, that is, when the test taker can eliminate at least one answer he or she thinks is wrong. Without eliminating any answers one's probability of answering correctly is 20%. Eliminating one wrong answer increases this probability to 25%; two, a 33.3% probability; three, a 50% probability of choosing the correct answer and thus earning the full point for the question.

==Taking the test==  
The SAT is offered seven times a [[year]] in the [[United States]], in October, November, December, January, March (or April, alternating), May, and June. The test is typically offered on the first Saturday of the month for the November, December, May, and June administrations. In other countries, the SAT is offered on the same dates as in the [[United States]] except for the first spring test date (i.e., March or April), which is not offered. In 2006, the test was taken 1,465,744 times.&lt;ref name=&quot;SATpercentiles&quot;&gt;The scoring categories are the following, Reading, Math, Writing, and Essay.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Candidates may either take the SAT Reasoning Test or up to three [[SAT Subject Tests]] on any given test date, except the first spring test date, when only the SAT Reasoning Test is offered. Candidates wishing to take the test may register online at the College Board's website, by mail, or by telephone, at least three weeks before the test date.  
  
The SAT Subject Tests are all given in one large book on test day. Therefore, it is actually immaterial which tests, and how many, the student signs up for; with the possible exception of the language tests with listening, the student may change his or her mind and take ''any'' tests, regardless of his or her initial sign-ups. Students who choose to take more subject tests than they signed up for will later be billed by College Board for the additional tests and their scores will be withheld until the bill is paid. Students who choose to take fewer subject tests than they signed up for are not eligible for a refund.

The SAT Reasoning Test costs $45 ($71 International). For the Subject tests, students pay a $20 Basic Registration Fee and $9 per test (except for language tests with listening, which cost $20 each).&lt;ref name=&quot;costs&quot;/&gt; The College Board makes fee waivers available for low income students. Additional fees apply for late registration, standby testing, registration changes, scores by telephone, and extra score reports (beyond the four provided for free).  
  
Candidates whose religious beliefs prevent them from taking the test on a Saturday may request to take the test on the following Sunday, except for the October test date in which the Sunday test date is eight days after the main test offering. Such requests must be made at the time of registration and are subject to denial.

Students with verifiable disabilities, including physical and learning disabilities, are eligible to take the SAT with accommodations. The standard time increase for students requiring additional time due to learning disabilities is 50%.

==Raw scores, scaled scores, and percentiles==  
Students receive their online score report approximately three weeks after administration of the test (six weeks for mailed, paper scores), with each section graded on a scale of 200&amp;ndash;800 and two sub scores for the writing section: the essay score and the multiple choice sub score. In addition to their score, students receive their [[percentile]] (the percentage of other test takers with lower scores). The raw score, or the number of points gained from correct answers and lost from incorrect answers (ranges from just under 50 to just under 60, depending upon the test), is also included.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/sat/help/global/viewscores/ My SAT: Help&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Students may also receive, for an additional fee, the Question and Answer Service, which provides the student's answer, the correct answer to each question, and online resources explaining each question.  
  
The corresponding percentile of each scaled score varies from test to test&amp;mdash;for example, in 2003, a scaled score of 800 in both sections of the SAT Reasoning Test corresponded to a percentile of 99.9, while a scaled score of 800 in the SAT Physics Test corresponded to the 94th percentile. The differences in what scores mean with regard to percentiles are because of the content of the exam and the caliber of students choosing to take each exam. Subject Tests are subject to intensive study (often in the form of an [[Advanced Placement Program|AP]], which is relatively more difficult), and only those who know they will perform well tend to take these tests, creating a skewed distribution of scores.

Although there is no official conversion chart between the SAT and its biggest rival, the [[ACT (examination)|ACT]], the College Board released an unofficial chart based on results from 103,525 test takers who took both tests between October 1994 and December 1996 [http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/highered/ra/sat/satACT_concordance.pdf here]; however, both tests have changed since then. Several colleges have also issued their own charts.

Originally used mainly by colleges and universities in the north-eastern United States, and  developed by [[Carl Brigham]], one of the psychologists who worked on the Army Alpha and Beta tests&lt;!-- Reference, Kline, K. and Davidshofer, C 2005 --&gt;, the SAT was originally developed as a way to eliminate test bias between people from different socio-economic backgrounds.

===1901 test===
The College Board began on [[June 17]], [[1901]], when 973 students took its first test, across 67 locations in the United States, and two in Europe. Although those taking the test came from a variety of backgrounds, approximately one third were from [[New York]], [[New Jersey]], or [[Pennsylvania]]. The majority of those taking the test were from private schools, academies, or endowed schools. About 60% of those taking the test applied to [[Columbia University]]. The test contained sections on English, [[French (language)|French]], [[German (language)|German]], [[Latin]], [[Greek (language)|Greek]], history, mathematics, [[chemistry]], and [[physics]]. The test was not multiple choice, but instead was evaluated based on essay responses as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;doubtful,&quot; &quot;poor,&quot; or &quot;very poor.&quot; &lt;ref name=Frontline1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/sats/where/1901.html | title=frontline: secrets of the sat: where did the test come from?: the 1901 college board | accessdate=2007-10-20 |work=Secrets of the SAT |publisher=[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1926 test===
The first administration of the SAT occurred on [[June 23]], [[1926]], when it was known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test.&lt;ref name=CBHistorical /&gt;&lt;ref name=Frontline2 /&gt; This test, prepared by a committee headed by Princeton psychologist Carl Campbell Brigham, had sections of [[definition]]s, [[arithmetic]], classification&lt;!-- possibly [[Classification (literature)]] ? I do not know, and it's hard to find a source --&gt;, artificial language&lt;!-- I'm hesitant to link to [[artificial language]], since the meaning could be so broad --&gt;, [[antonym]]s, number series, [[analogies]], [[logical inference]], and paragraph reading. It was administered to over 8,000 students at over 300 test centers. Men composed 60% of the test-takers. Slightly over a quarter of males and females applied to [[Yale University]] and [[Smith College]] respectively. &lt;ref name=Frontline2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/sats/where/1926.html | title=frontline: secrets of the sat: where did the test come from?: the 1926 sat | accessdate=2007-10-20 |work=Secrets of the SAT |publisher=[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test was paced considerably quickly, with 315 questions asked in only a little over an hour and a half.&lt;ref name=CBHistorical&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/research/pdf/rr20027_11439.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |title=Research Report No. 2002-7: A Historical Perspective on the SAT®: 1926–2001 |year=[[2002]] |accessdate=2007-10-20 |last=Lawrence |first=Ida |coauthors=Rigol, Gretchen W.; Van Essen, Thomas; Jackson, Carol A. |publisher=College Entrance Examination Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1928 and 1929 tests===
In 1928 the number of verbal sections was reduced to 7, and the time limit was increased to slightly under two hours. In 1929 the number of sections was again reduced, this time to 6. These changes in part loosened time constraints on test-takers. Math was eliminated entirely for these tests, instead focusing only on verbal ability.&lt;ref name=CBHistorical /&gt;

===1930 test and 1936 changes===
In [[1930]] the SAT was first split into the verbal and math sections, a structure that would continue through [[2004]]. The verbal section of the 1930 test covered a more narrow range on content than its predecessors, examining only antonyms, double definitions (somewhat similar to sentence completions), and paragraph reading. In [[1936]], analogies were re-added. Between 1936 and [[1946]], students had between 80 and 115 minutes to answer 250 verbal questions (over a third of which were on antonyms). The mathematics test introduced in 1930 contained 100 free response questions to be answered in 80 minutes, and focused primarily on speed. From 1936 to [[1941]], like the 1928 and 1929 tests, the mathematics section was eliminated entirely. When the mathematics portion of the test was re-added in [[1942]], it consisted of multiple choice questions.&lt;ref name=CBHistorical /&gt; 

===1946 test and associated changes===
Paragraph reading was eliminated from the verbal portion of the SAT in 1946, and replaced with reading comprehension, and &quot;double definition&quot; questions were replaced with sentence completions. Between 1946 and [[1957]] students were given 90 to 100 minutes to complete 107 to 170 verbal questions. Starting in [[1958]] time limits became more stable, and for 17 years, until [[1975]], students had 75 minutes to answer 90 questions. In [[1959]] questions on data sufficiency were introduced to the mathematics section, and then replaced with quantitative comparisons in [[1974]]. In 1974 both verbal and math sections were reduced from 75 minutes to 60 minutes each, with changes in test composition compensating for the decreased time.&lt;ref name=CBHistorical /&gt;

===1980 test and associated changes===
The inclusion of the &quot;Strivers&quot; Score study was implemented.  This study was introduced by The Educational Testing Service, which administers the SAT, and has been conducting research on how to make it easier for minorities and individuals who suffer from social and economic barriers.
The original &quot;Strivers&quot; project, which was in the research phase from 1980 - 1994, awarded special &quot;Striver&quot; status to test-takers who scored 200 points higher than expected for their race, gender and income level.  The belief was that this would give minorities a better chance at being accepted in to a college of higher standard, i.e. an Ivy League school.  In 1992, the Strivers Project was leaked to the public; as a result the Strivers Project was terminated in 1993.  After Federal Courts heard arguments from the ACLU, NAACP and the Educational Testing Service, the courts ordered the study to alter its data collection process, stating that only the age, race and zip code could be used to determine the test-takers eligibility for &quot;Strivers&quot; points.
These changes were introduced to the SAT effective in 1994.

===1994 changes===
In [[1994]] the verbal section received a dramatic change in focus. Among these changes were the removal of [[antonym]] questions, and an increased focus on passage reading. The mathematics section also saw a dramatic change in 1994, thanks in part to pressure from the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]]. For the first time since 1935, the SAT asked some non-multiple choice questions, instead requiring students to supply the answers. 1994 also saw the introduction of calculators into the mathematics section for the first time in the test's history. The mathematics section introduced concepts of probability, slope, elementary statistics, counting problems, median and mode.&lt;ref name=CBHistorical /&gt;

The average score on the 1994 modification of the SAT I was usually around 1000 (500 on the verbal, 500 on the math). The most selective schools in the United States (for example, those in the [[Ivy League]]) typically had SAT averages exceeding 1400 on the old test.

===2002 changes - &quot;score choice&quot;===
In October 2002, the College Board decided to drop the &quot;score choice&quot; option for exams.  They figured that it benefited wealthier students taking the exam who could afford to take it multiple times.  Score choice means that scores are not released to colleges until the student approves the score (after seeing it).  &lt;ref&gt;Schoenfeld, Jane. College board drops 'score choice' for SAT-II exams. St. Louis Business Journal, May 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 changes===
In 2005, the test was changed again, largely in response to criticism by the [[University of California system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynexus.com/article.php?a=3385 College Board To Alter SAT I for 2005-06 - Daily Nexus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of issues concerning ambiguous questions, especially [[analogy|analogies]], certain types of questions were eliminated (the analogies from the verbal and quantitative comparisons from the Math section). The test was made marginally harder, as a corrective to the rising number of perfect scores. A new writing section, with an essay, based on the former SAT II Writing Subject Test, was added, in part to increase the chances of closing the opening gap between the highest and midrange scores. Other factors included the desire to test the writing ability of each student in a personal manner; hence the essay. The New SAT (known as the SAT Reasoning Test) was first offered on [[March 12]], [[2005]], after the last administration of the &quot;old&quot; SAT in January of 2005.  The Mathematics section was expanded to cover three years of high school mathematics.  The Verbal section's name was changed to the Critical reading section.

===2008 changes===
In [[2008]], the &quot;score choice&quot; which was dropped in 2002 will be put into effect starting with the March 2009 SAT examination for the Class of 2010. With this new policy, students will be able to select which scores they will send to colleges by test date.

==Name changes and recentered scores==
In 1990, because of uncertainty about the SAT's ability to function as an [[intelligence test]], the name was changed to Scholastic Assessment Test. Finally, in 1994, the name was changed to simply SAT (with the [[Pseudo-acronym|letters not standing for anything]]). Now the test is commonly referred to as the SAT Reasoning Test. The scoring categories are now the following: Reading, Math, Writing, and Essay. The essay has its own score now.

The test scoring was initially scaled to make 500 the mean score on each section with a [[standard deviation]] of 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570026_3/intelligence.html |title=Intelligence |publisher=[[MSN Encarta]] |accessdate=2008-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the test grew more popular and more students from less rigorous schools began taking the test, the average dropped to about 428 Verbal and 478 Math. The SAT was &quot;recentered&quot; in 1995, and the average &quot;new&quot; score became again close to 500. Scores awarded after 1994 and before October 2001 are officially reported with an &quot;R&quot; (e.g. 1260R) to reflect this change. Old scores may be recentered to compare to 1995 to present scores by using official College Board tables&lt;ref&gt;[http://professionals.collegeboard.com/data-reports-research/sat/equivalence-tables/sat-score SAT I Individual Score Equivalents&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
, which in the middle ranges add about 70 points to Verbal and 20 or 30 points to Math. In other words, current students have a 100 (70 plus 30) point advantage over their parents.

==Controversy==
===Scoring problems of October 2005 tests===
In March of 2006, it was announced that a small percentage of the SATs taken in October 2005 had been scored incorrectly due to the test papers being moist and not scanning properly, and that some students had received substantially erroneous scores. The College Board announced they would change the scores for the students who were given a lower score than they earned, but at this point many of those students had already applied to colleges using their original scores. The College Board decided not to change the scores for the students who were given a higher score than they earned. A lawsuit was filed in 2005 by about 4,400 students who received an incorrect low score on the SAT. The class-action suit was settled in August 2007 when The College Board and another company that administers the college-admissions test announced they would pay $2.85 million to over 4,000 students. Under the agreement each student can either elect to receive $275 or submit a claim for more money if he or she feels the damage was even greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/news/index.php?id=2911 |title=$2.85-Million Settlement Proposed in Lawsuit Over SAT-Scoring Errors |accessdate=2007-08-27 |date= [[2007-08-24]] |last=Hoover |first=Eric |Publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Bias===

A famous example of alleged bias in the SAT I is the [[oarsman]]-[[regatta]] analogy question.&lt;ref&gt;''Don't Believe the Hype'', Chideya, 1995; ''[http://epaa.asu.edu/epaa/v3n2.html The Bell Curve]'', Hernstein and Murray, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the question was to find the pair of terms that have the relationship most similar to the relationship between &quot;runner&quot; and &quot;marathon&quot;. The correct answer was &quot;oarsman&quot; and &quot;regatta&quot;.

[[Image:1995-SAT-Education2.png|right|thumb|200px|]]
[[Image:1995-SAT-Income2.png|right|thumb|200px|As depicted above, SAT scores vary according to race, income, and parental educational background.]]

The question relied upon students knowing the meaning of the two terms, referring to a sport popular with the wealthy.  Fifty-three percent (53%) of white students correctly answered the question, and 22% of black students did.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmag.org/racewatch/znet_race_instructional5.htm Culture And Racism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Analogy questions have since been replaced by short reading passages.

===Dropping SAT===
A few [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]] have responded to this criticism by joining the [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States#SAT optional movement|SAT optional movement]]. These colleges do not require the SAT for admission.

In a 2001 speech to the [[American Council on Education]], [[Richard C. Atkinson]], then president of the [[University of California]], urged dropping the SAT Reasoning Test as a college admissions requirement:

:&quot;Anyone involved in education should be concerned about how overemphasis on the SAT is distorting educational priorities and practices, how the test is perceived by many as unfair, and how it can have a devastating impact on the self-esteem and aspirations of young students. There is widespread agreement that overemphasis on the SAT harms American education.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucop.edu/pres/speeches/achieve.htm Achievement Versus Aptitude Tests in College Admissions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to threats by the University of California to drop the SAT as an admission requirement, the College Entrance Examination Board announced the restructuring of the SAT, to take effect in March 2005, as detailed above.

===Essay===
In 2005, [[MIT]] Writing Director [[Les Perelman]] plotted essay length versus essay score on the new SAT from released essays and found a high correlation between them. After studying 23 graded essays he found that the longer the essay was, the higher the score. He also discovered that several of these essays were full of factual errors. However, the official SAT guide for scorers state that the essays should be scored according to their quality of writing and not factual accuracy. The National Council of Teachers of English also criticize the 25-minute writing section of the test, arguing that the basic principles of writing encourage the revision of written material several times. They say that the amount of time allowed for the test pushes schools to develop a formulaic system of writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/04/education/04education.html?ei=5090&amp;en=94808505ef7bed5a&amp;ex=1272859200&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all The New York Times &gt; Education &gt; On Education: SAT Essay Test Rewards Length and Ignores Errors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test preparation==
Many companies and organizations offer test preparation in the form of books, classes, online courses, and tutoring.  Large organizations include the Princeton Review, Kaplan, Barron's, Elite Educational Institute, Revolution Prep, Ivy Insiders, and College Board (the test makers).  Some have criticized the SAT test because preparation often can lead to much higher scores, but some have embraced the opportunity to improve their scores.

{{otheruses2|Home Improvement}}

'''Home improvement''' or '''home renovation''' is the process of [[renovation|renovating]] or making additions to one's home. 

The [[sitcom]] ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' used the home improvement [[Theme (literature)|theme]] for comedic purposes.
American cable channel [[HGTV]] features many do-it-yourself shows, as does sister channel [[DIY Network]] and the competing [[Discovery Home]].

==Types of home improvement==
While it most often refers to building projects that alter the structure of an existing [[home]], home renovation can include improvements to lawns and [[gardens]] and outbuildings like gazebos and [[garage (house)|garages]].

Home improvement projects generally have one or more of the following goals:

===Beautification and added features===
*[[Wallpaper]]ing and [[painting]] [[wall]]s or installing [[wood]] [[panelling]].
*Adding new [[flooring]] such as [[carpet]]s, [[tile|tiling]], [[linoleum]], [[parquetry|wood flooring]], or solid [[hardwood flooring]].
*Upgrading [[cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]]s, [[fixture]]s, and [[sink]]s in the [[kitchen]] and [[bathroom]].
*Replacing [[siding]] and [[window]]s
*Improving the [[backyard]] with [[sliding door]]s, wooden patio [[deck (building)|deck]]s, [[patio garden]]s, [[jacuzzi]]s, [[swimming pool]]s, and [[fence|fencing]].

===Comfort===
*Upgrading [[heating]], [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and [[air conditioning]] systems (HVAC)
*Increasing the capacity of [[plumbing]] and [[electrical]] systems.
*[[Waterproofing]] [[basement]]s.
*[[Soundproofing]] rooms, especially bedrooms and baths.

===Maintenance and repair===
Maintenance projects can include:
*[[Roof]] tear-off and replacement.
*[[Concrete]] and [[masonry]] repairs to the [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] and [[chimney]].
*Repairing [[plumbing]] and [[electrical]] systems.

===Additional space===
Additional living space may be added by:
*Turning marginal areas into livable spaces such as turning basements into [[recreation room|recroom]]s or [[attic]]s into spare [[bedroom]]s.
*Extending one's house with rooms added to the side of one's home or, sometimes, extra levels to the original [[roof]].

===Saving energy===
Homeowners may reduce [[public utility|utility]] costs with:
*[[Energy efficiency|Energy-efficient]] [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], windows, and [[lighting]].
*[[Renewable energy]]  with [[biomass]] [[pellet stove]]s, wood-burning [[stove]]s, [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s, [[wind turbine]]s, and [[geothermal exchange heat pump]]s (see [[autonomous building]])

===Safety and preparedness===
[[Emergency preparedness]] safety measures such as:
*Home [[burglar alarm|fire and burglar alarm]] systems.
*Security doors, windows, and [[window shutter|shutters]].
*[[Storm cellar]]s as protection from tornadoes and hurricanes.
*[[Fallout shelter|Bombshelters]] especially during the 1950s as protection from nuclear war.

==Professional versus do-it-yourself==
There are three main approaches to managing a home improvement project: hiring a general contractor, directly hiring specialized contractors, or doing the work oneself.

A [[general contractor]] oversees a home improvement project that involves multiple trades. A general contractor acts as project manager, providing access to the site, removing debris, coordinating work schedules, and performing some aspects of the work. 

Sometimes homeowners bypass the general contractor, and hire tradesmen themselves, including [[plumbers]], [[electrician]]s and [[roofer]]s.  

Another strategy is to &quot;do it yourself&quot; ([[DIY]]).  Several major American retailers, such as [[Home Depot]] and [[Lowes]], specialize in selling materials and tools for DIY home improvement.  These stores host classes and carry numerous books to teach customers how to do the work themselves.  DIY websites also provide information.

==Home improvement industry==
Home or [[residential]] renovation is a $300 billion industry in the [[United States]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NAHB&quot;&gt;National Association of Home Builders&lt;/ref&gt; and a $48 billion industry in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CMHC&quot;&gt;[http://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/ Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt;  The average cost per project is $3,000 in the United States and $11,000-15,000 in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;JCHS&quot;&gt;Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are several types of companies that contribute to the booming renovation industry.  Supply businesses such as [[Home Depot]], [[Lowes]], [[Home Hardware]] and [[Rona (company)|Rona]] Lansing provide all the materials and tools necessary to facilitate home renovations.  
Several media companies and online companies and [http://www.allaboutthehome.info/ home improvement] site offer tips, guidelines and trends give homeowners ideas for [[design]] and [[décor]].

===Associations===
Playing a critical role are the [[professional association]]s created to represent the [[architects]], architectural technologists, [[interior designer]]s and skilled trades that provide specialized services to [[homeowners]].  These associations provide credibility, trade guidelines and useful information to help homeowners learn more about the trades they are about to hire.

Associations include:

*[http://www.cca-acc.com/ CCA]
*[http://www.ecao.org/ ECAO]
*[http://www.roofingcanada.com/ CRCA]
*[http://www.nari.org/ NARI]

===Renovation Contractors===
Perhaps the most important or visible professionals in the renovation industry are renovation contractors or skilled trades.  These are the [[builders]] that have specialized [[credentials]], licensing and experience to perform renovation services in specific [[municipalities]].  
While there is a fairly large ‘grey market’ of unlicensed companies, there are those that have membership in a reputable association or are accredited by a professional organization.

'''Italian cuisine''' as a national [[cuisine]] known today has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Its roots can be traced back to the 4th century BC. The cuisine changed significantly with discovery of the [[New World]] which helped shape much of what is known as Italian cuisine today with the introduction of items such as [[potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[bell pepper]] and [[maize]], which are all central parts of the cuisine but were not introduced in scale until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Del Conte, 11-21.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Ingredients and dishes vary by region. There are many significant regional dishes that have become both national and regional. Many dishes that were once regional, however, have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. Cheese and wine are also a major part of the cuisine, playing different roles both regionally and nationally with their many variations and [[Denominazione di origine controllata]] (DOC) (regulated appellation) laws. [[Coffee]], and more specifically [[espresso]], has become highly important to the cultural cuisine of Italy.

==History==
Italian cuisine has evolved extensively over the centuries. Although the country known as Italy today had not officially formed until the 19th century, the cuisine can claim roots going back as far as 4th century BC. Through various influences throughout the centuries, including neighboring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political upheavals as well as the discovery of the New World, a concrete cuisine has formed to what is known today as one of the premiere cuisines in the world.

===Antiquity===
:''See also: [[Roman cuisine]]''
The first known [[food writer]] has been traced back to the 4th century BCE. This writer was a Greek Sicilian named [[Archestratus]], who lived in [[Province of Syracuse|Syracuse]].  His writing was a poem that spoke of using &quot;top quality and seasonal&quot; ingredients of the freshest nature. He also stated that the flavors of the dishes should not be masked by [[spice]]s, [[herb]]s, or other seasonings with an importance put upon this style of preparation for [[fish]]. This style of cuisine seemed to be forgotten during the 1st century AD when ''[[De re coquinaria]]'' was published with 470 recipes included many with heavy usage of spices, herbs which would hide much of the natural flavor of the dish they were used in, much of this would have been considered what would be eaten in the [[patrician]] household. This does not suggest that the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] of the time did not appreciate high quality ingredients. The Romans employed the best [[Greek people|Greek]] bakers to produce their [[bread]]s, imported pecorini from [[Sicily]] as the Sicilians were known for producing the best [[Cheesemaker|cheese makers]]. The Romans were also known as being excellent rearer of goats for butchering and gardening of [[artichoke]]s and [[leek]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Del Conte, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
:''See also: [[medieval cuisine]]''
[[Muslim]]s invaded Sicily during the 9th century as most of what is known today as [[Northern Europe]] was being attacked by [[Viking]] raiders.  As Sicily had already attained much of the culinary traditions from [[Rome]] and [[Athens]], the highly civilized culture combined with the Sicilian to bring what many consider the first real Italian cuisine in Sicily. The [[Arab]]s introduced [[spinach]], [[almond]]s and [[rice]] and some say [[spaghetti]] as it made its possible first appearance during the 12th century AD when the [[Normans|Norman]] king made a survey of Sicily and noted that he saw people making long strings made from flour and water called ''atriya'', which eventually became ''trii'' which is another term used for spaghetti in southern Italy. Normans also introduced casseroling, [[salt cod]] (baccalà) and [[stockfish]] which remain extremely popular today.&lt;ref&gt;Del Conte, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Food preservation]] techniques were a necessity as refrigeration had not yet been invented. The two types of preservation were either chemical or physical. Meats and fish would be smoked, dried or kept on ice. [[Brine]] and [[salt]] were used to preserve items like [[pickles]], [[herring]] and to cure pork meat. [[Root vegetable]]s were also preserved in brine after they had been [[parboiled]]. Other items used to preserve foods included [[oil]], [[vinegar]] or immersing animal proteins in their own congealed, rendered fat. For preserving fruits, liquor, honey and sugar were used.&lt;ref&gt;Capatti, 253-254.&lt;/Ref&gt;

[[Image:6-alimenti, pasta,Taccuino Sanitatis, Casanatense 4182..jpg|thumb|200px|Making noodles; ''[[Tacuinum Sanitatis]]'', 14th century.]]
The northern regions of future Italy started to show a mix of Germanic and [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] while the southern portion continued to reflect the influences of Arab culture as they controlled much of the [[Mediterranean]] [[trade route]]s, as such much of the [[Cuisine of the Mediterranean|Mediterranean cuisine]] had been spread by the Arab trade.&lt;ref&gt;Capatti, 2-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Italian book on cuisine is ''Liber de coquina'' written in [[Naples]] during the 13th century. Dishes included &quot;Roman-style&quot; [[cabbage]] (''ad usum romanorum''), ''ad usum campanie'' which was &quot;small leaves&quot; prepared in the &quot;Campanian manner&quot;, a bean dish reflecting the Marca di Trevisio, a ''torta'', ''compositum londardicum'' which are extremely similar to dishes prepared today in Italy. In two other books from the 14th century recipes are found for Roman ''pastello'', Lavagna pie, use of [[salt]] from [[Sardinia]] or [[Chioggia]] again reflecting the importance of the regions of Italy and the foundations of integral dishes.&lt;ref&gt;Capatti, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 15th century Maestro Martino was chef to the [[Patriarch of Aquileia]] at the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. His manuscript ''Libro de arte coquinaria'' began to illustrate a cuisine with a more refined and elegant design. In his book contains a recipe for ''Maccaroni Siciliani'' which was made by wrapping dough around a thin iron rod and dried in the sun. The macaroni was to be cooked in [[capon]] stock flavored with [[saffron]], illustrating the Arab influence. Of particularly note is Chef Martino's shedding the use of excessive spices in favor of fresh herbs.&lt;ref&gt;Del Conte, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Martino's cuisine created a methodology that respected proper selection and modes of preparation. The Roman recipes mentioned in the text includes recipes for ''coppiette'' and cabbage dishes. His [[Florentine]] dishes included eggs with a ''Bolognese torta'', ''Sienese torta'' and for [[Genoa|Genoese]] recipes such as ''piperata'', macaroni, [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[mushroom]]s, and [[spinach]] pie with [[onion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Capatti, 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martino's manuscript was included in a book printed during 1475 in [[Venice]] written by [[Bartolomeo Platina]] entitled ''[[De honesta voluptate et valetudine]]'' (&quot;On Honest Pleasure and Good Health&quot;). Platina puts Martino's &quot;Libro&quot; in cultural context reflexing different regions of Italy including the [[Po Valley]], [[Liguria]], [[Campania]], Piceno, [[Apulia]], and Sicily. He speaks of ingredients coming from various regions, including [[perch]] from [[Lake Maggiore]], [[sardine]]s from [[Lake Garda]], [[grayling]] from [[Adda]], hens from [[Padua]], [[olive]]s from [[Bologna]] and Piceno, [[turbot]] from [[Ravenna]], [[rudd]] from [[Lake Trasimeno]], [[carrot]]s from [[Viterbo]], [[bass (fish)|bass]] from [[Tiber]], ''roviglioni'' and [[shad]] from [[Lake Albano]], [[snail]]s from [[Rieti]], [[fig]]s from Tuscolo, [[grape]]s from [[Narni]], [[oil]] from [[Cassino]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]s from [[Naples]] and [[Moray eel|moray]] from [[Campania]]. Grains from [[Lombardy]] and Campania are also mentioned as is [[honey]] from Sicily and Taranto. The [[wine]]s he mentions are from the Ligurian coast, Grecco from Tuscany and [[San Severino]] and [[Trebbiano]] from Tuscany and Piceno.&lt;ref&gt;Capatti, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern era===
The courts of Florence, Rome, Venice and Ferrara were integral to the creation of the fine cooking in Italy. The court of [[Estes]] in Ferrara was a central figure to the creation of this high-cuisine.  Christoforo Messisbugo steward to [[Ippolito d'Este]] published ''Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande'' in 1549. In this work Messisbugo details banquets in the first-half of the book, in the second-half of the book contains a multitude of recipes for items such as pies and tarts (containing 124 recipes with various fillings). The work does emphasize the use of Eastern spices and sugar which was at this time otherwise beginning to diminish.&lt;ref&gt;Del Conte, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Image:Scappi.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Bartolomeo Scappi]] personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]]]]
In 1570 ''Opera'' was written by [[Bartolomeo Scappi]] personal chef to [[Pope Pius V]]. This was a five-volume work that to that date encompassed the most comprehensive example of Italian cooking. The work contained over 1,000 recipes, with information on banquets including displays and menus as well as illustrations of kitchen and table utensils. The difference between most books written for the royal courts and this volume is its shedding of game and other meats and includes instead domestic animals and courtyard birds which was more inline with the &quot;modest household&quot;. Recipes are also included how to clean and use lesser cuts of meats including tongue, head, and shoulder. The third book contains recipes for fish, or [[Lent]] cookery. Preparations for fish are simple including [[Poaching (cooking)|poaching]], [[broil]]ing, [[grill]]ed, or fried after being marinated. Particular attention is given to seasons in which fish should be caught and in which location. The final volume includes pies, tarts, fritters and includes a recipe for a Neapolitan [[pizza]]. This version of the Neapolitan pizza is not the savory version known today, it was instead a sweet version as tomatoes had not been introduced to Italy as-of-yet. There were recipes for [[corn]] and [[turkey]] however, which were items from the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Del Conte, 14,15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:L'arte.jpg|thumb|left|100px|''L'arte di Ben Cucinare'' published by Bartolomeo Stefani in 1662]]
During the first decade of the 17th century chef Giangiacomo Castelvetro published ''Brieve Racconto di Tutte le Radici di Tutte l'Herbe et di Tutti i Frutti'' (''A Brief Account of all Vegetables, Herbs and Fruit'') which was translated into English by Gillian Riley.  Originally from [[Modena]], Castelvetro moved to [[England]] because of his [[Protestant]] background. The book included an in-depth listing of Italian vegetables and fruits as well as their preparation. The chef's preparation of vegetables featured them at times as a central part of the meal, not just accompaniments. The favored preparation (still popular in Italy today) was to simmer vegetables in salted water and serving them warm or cold with olive oil, salt, fresh ground pepper, [[Lemon|lemon juice]] and [[verjus]] or orange juice. Another preparation includes roasting vegetables wrapped in damp paper over charcoal or embers with a drizzle of olive oil, again a technique still popular today in Italy. Castelvetro's book is separated into seasons with mentions of hop shoots in the spring and truffles in the winter detailing the truffle scavenge with the use of pigs. New World items were not mentioned in this book as they did not become popular until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Del Conte, 14,15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1662 Bartolomeo Stefani chef to Gonzagas published ''L'Arte di Ben Cucinare''. He was the last chef to publish a book of Italian high-cuisine, but the first to offer a full section on ''vitto ordinario'' (&quot;ordinary food&quot;). The book contained a section on a banquet given by Gonzagas for [[Queen Christina]] of [[Sweden]] with details for preparation prior to the banquet, preparation of the food and table settings including each guest having a setting of a knife, fork, spoon, glass, a plate instead of bowls often used up to this point and a napkin. Other books were published at this time to illustrate how ''scalco'' (server) should manage themselves while serving their guests. An important book to take up this topic was ''Galatheo'' by [[Giovanni della Casa]]. The book instructed waiters to not scratch their heads or other parts of themselves, not to spit, cough or sneeze while serving diners. The book also instructed diners to not use their fingers while eating as well as not wipe their sweat with their napkin.&lt;ref&gt;Del Conte, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
Much of what is known as Italy today was still governed by [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Austria]] in the 18th century. In turn it was at the beginning of the 18th century that the culinary books of Italy began to show the [[regionalism]] of Italian cuisine in order for Italian chefs to better show the pride of their home regions. The books written at the time were also no longer addressed to professional chefs but to [[bourgeois]] housewives who could address their home cook.&lt;ref&gt;De Conte, 16&lt;/ref&gt; Originating in booklet form, periodicals such as ''La cuoca cremonese'' (The cook of Cremona) written in 1794 gives a sequence of ingredients according to season along with chapters on meat, fish and vegetables. As the century progressed these books increased in size, popularity and frequency, while the price to attain them dropped well within the reach of the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;Capatti, 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th century peasant diet consisted of heavy foods, necessary in an age where food was practically the only source of energy. Even medical texts of the time written by the elite warned peasants from eating refined foods as it was poor for their digestion and their bodies required a more substantial heavy meal to satisfy their hunger. It was also thought that peasants had coarse stomachs which were unable to digest refined foods and it was believed by some that peasants ate poorly because they were accustomed to eating poorly, resulting from the fact that many peasants had to resort to eating rotten foods and moldy breads in order to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Capatti, 282-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:081 Vialardi frontes.jpg|thumb|right|100px|''Cucina Borghese'' published by Chef Giovanni Vialardi in 19th century]]
In 1779 [[Antonio Nebbia]] from [[Macerata]], in the [[Marche]] region, wrote ''Il Cuoco Maceratese'' (The Cook of Macerata). In this book, Nebbia addressed the importance of local vegetables plus [[pasta]] and [[gnocchi]]. Instead of pureed soups in the French style, they included [[Mediterranean]] vegetables along with pasta or rice. For stocks, vegetables and chicken were favored over meat. Similarly, Vincenzo Corrado wrote ''Il Cuoco Galante'' (The Courteous Cook) in Naples in 1773 which featured regional vegetables and ingredients. Particular emphasis was given to ''Vitto Pitagorico'' (vegetarian food) in his words &quot;Pitagoric food consists of fresh herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, seeds and all that is produced in the earth for our nourishment. It is so called because [[Pythagoras]], as is well known, only used such produce. There is no doubt that this kind of food appears to be more natural to man, and the use of meat is noxious.&quot; It was also this book that the tomato took its first central role with thirteen recipes. ''Zuppa alli Pomidoro'' first appears in Corrado's book, it is a dish similar to today's [[Tuscan Pappa al Pomodoro]]. In Corrado's 1798 edition he introduced a &quot;Treatise on the Potato&quot; after the approval of France through [[Antoine-Augustin Parmentier]]'s successful promotion.&lt;ref&gt;De Conte, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century changes could even be noticed in the writing of chef Giovanni Vialardi, chef to the first king of Italy. In his book ''A Treatise of Modern Cookery and Patisserie'' published in [[Turin]] Vialardi wrote on recipes &quot;suitable for a modest household.&quot; Many of his recipes included regional dishes from Turin including twelve recipes for potatoes ''Genoese Cappon Magro'', still an integral regional dish today. Published in 1829, ''Il Nuovo Cuoco Milanese Economico'' written by [[Giovanni Felice Luraschi]] feature dishes regional to [[Milan]] including Kidney with Anchovies and Lemon and Gnocchi alla Romana, also essential to this day. Gian Battista and Giovanni Ratto published ''La Cucina Genovese'' in 1871 and addressed the regional cuisine of [[Liguria]]. This book contained the first recipe for [[pesto]]. ''La Cucina Teorico-Pratica'' written by Ippolito Cavalcanti mentions the first recipe for pasta with tomatoes in his conversational tone not often seen before this time..&lt;ref&gt;De Conte, 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; ''La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiare bene'' (The Science of Cooking and the Art of Eating Well), by [[Pellegrino Artusi]], first published in 1891, is widely regarded as the canon of classic modern Italian cuisine, and its use is still widespread throughout Italy today. It contains recipes come mainly from Romagna and Tuscany, the regions where he was born and raised and where he subsequently lived.

==Regional cuisines==
[[Image:Regions of Italy.svg|thumb|right|280px|The 20 ''[[Regione|Regioni]]'' of [[Italy]] ]]
Each area has its own proud specialties, primarily at regional level, but also even at provincial level. These regional variances can come from the influence of a bordering country (such as France or Austria), vicinity to the sea or mountains as well as economic progress. Italian cuisine is not only highly regional, but is also distinguished by being very seasonal with high priority placed on the use of fresh, seasonal produce.

===Friuli-Venezia Giulia===
[[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] shares many traditions with the bordering former [[Yugoslavia]]. The famous [[San Daniele del Friuli]] [[ham]]s come from this region. Carnia in the northern region is known for its [[bacon]] and Montasio [[cheese]]. Collio, Grave del Friuli, and Colli Orientali are regional [[wine]] favorites. The dishes of the region take on the influence of [[Austria]]n, [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]], [[Slovenes|Slovene]], and [[Croats|Croatian]] dishes. [[Beer]] halls of the region feature Viennese sausage, [[goulash]] and [[Bohemian]] [[hare]]. Many of the desserts of the region are [[flour]] based, such as [[strudel]]s. [[Polenta]] is a staple and it finds its way into many variations including stirred dishes, baked dishes and can be seen served with [[sausage]], [[cheese]], [[fish]], or [[meat]]. Dishes made with [[pork]] are often seen and can often be spicy and are often prepared over the open hearth called the ''fogolar''.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Steinpilzrisotto.jpg|left|thumb|125px|A dish of risotto]]
[[Veneto]] is well known for [[risotto]].It is a dish where the added ingredients differ by according to location, with [[fish]] and [[seafood]] being added closer to the coast and [[pumpkin]], [[asparagus]], [[radicchio]] and [[frogs' legs]] appearing further away from the [[Adriatic]]. [[Bean]]s and other [[legume]]s are seen in these areas with the dish ''[[pasta e fagioli]]'' being a unique combination of beans and pasta. Veneto features heavier dishes using exotic spices and sauces. Ingredients like [[stockfish]] or simple marinated [[anchovie]]s are found here as well. Less fish is eaten in Veneto and more meat and [[sausage]]s are preferred such as the famous [[sopressata]] and [[garlic]] [[salami]]. High quality [[vegetable]]s are prized here with red [[radicchio]] from [[Treviso]] being prized as well as [[asparagus]] from [[Bassano del Grappa]].&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hungarian goulash.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Goulash]] with [[gnocchi]]]]
Prior to the [[Council of Trent]] in 1550 [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]] was known for simplicity in cuisine. When the [[prelate]]s of the [[Church]] came they brought the art of fine cooking to the region. Fresh water fish is a specialty of this region. In later years the cuisine of the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Habsburg Empire]] were adopted. In the Alto Adige [[Alpine]] traditions are embraced which includes [[Slav]], [[Austria]]n, and [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] cuisines. [[Goulash]] can again be found here as a regular Sunday dish. [[Potato]]es, [[dumpling]]s and homemade [[sauerkraut]] called ''crauti''. [[Lard]] is a popular ingredient in this region. The national [[pasta]], [[tomato]]es and [[olive oil]] can be found popularized in this region as well.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lombardy===
[[Rice]] is a popular ingredient in [[Lombardy]] often found in [[soup]]s as well as [[risotto]]. Cheese is a popular course with ''[[robiola]]'' or ''[[crescenza]]'', ''[[taleggio]]'', ''[[gorgonzola]]'' (from the namesake town) and ''[[grana padano]]'' being particularly important (the vast plains of central and southern Lombardy allowing for intensive cattle-raising). For the same reason [[Butter]] is a popular ingredient over oil, and [[cream]] in generous amounts are often seen. Single pot dishes are popular here with the working class which take less labor to create. In the areas of [[Bergamo]], [[Brescia]], and [[Valtellina]] [[polenta]] is popular. In [[Mantua]] village festivals feature ''tortelli di zucca'' ([[ravioli]] with [[pumpkin]] filling) accompanied by melted butter and followed by [[turkey]] stuffed with [[chicken]] or other stewed [[meat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Val D'Aosta===
Bread thickened [[soup]]s of the hearty variety are customary in this region as well as [[cheese]] [[fondue]]s called ''fonduta'' typical of the [[Alpine]] region. [[Polenta]] is another popular staple along with [[rye bread]], smoked [[bacon]], and game meats found in the mountain and forest regions. [[Butter]] and [[cream]] are also important ingredients in the creation of stewed, roasted and braised dishes.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 123, 124, 128, 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cheese 15 bg 050306.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Gorgonzola cheese]]]]
===Piedmont===
[[Piedmont]] is a region where seasonal gathering of nuts, [[fungi]], [[cardoon]]s as well as seasonal [[hunting]] (especially wild game) and [[fishing]] takes place. [[Truffle]]s, [[garlic]], seasonal [[vegetable]]s, [[cheese]] and [[rice]] are all important staples to the region's diet. Wines from the [[Nebbiolo]] grape such as [[Barolo]] and [[Barbaresco]] stand out in this area as well as wines from the [[Barbera]] grape, fine [[sparkling wine]]s, and the sweet, lightly sparkling, [[Moscato d'Asti]].  ''[[Castelmagno (cheese)|Castelmagno]]'' is a prized cheese of the region. Filetto Baciato is the regions style of [[prosciutto]] made from [[pork]] fillet or other lean portion of pork marinated in white wine, coated with a salami paste and stuffed into a casing to age for six months.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 139, 149, 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liguria===

[[Liguria]] highly supports the use of local ingredients, the dishes found in this region will all feature the utmost freshness found in the local produce. Fresh herbs and vegetables as well as seafood find their way into the cuisine. [[Savory]] pies and cakes are popular in the region. [[Onion]]s and [[olive oil]] are found often in the cuisine which were helpful in their addition to [[vitamin C]] for the sailors who may have been lacking in the vitamin on long journeys. The Ligurians, constricted by a lack of terrain suited to wheat productions, made the most of [[chick-pea]] in [[farinata]] (plain or topped with [[onion]], [[artichokes]], [[sausage]], [[cheese]] or young [[anchovies]]) and polenta-like [[panissa]]. Hilly or mountainous districts used [[chestnuts]] as a ready source of carbohydrates and sugar. Ligurian pastas include ''corzetti'' from the Polcevera valley, ''pansoti'', a triangular shaped ravioli filled with vegetables, ''piccagge'', pasta ribbons made with a small amount of egg and commonly served with [[artichoke]] sauce or [[pesto]], ''[[trenette]]'', made from [[Whole wheat flour|wholewheat flour]] cut into long strips and served with pesto, boiled beans and potatoes, and ''trofie'', a Ligurian [[gnocchi]] made from wholegrain flour or white wheat flour, made into a spiral shape and cooked with beans and potatoes and often tossed in pesto.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 167, 177.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Ligurian tradition we also find exchanges with Argentina, where many Ligurians were forced to emigrate in late XIX and early XX centuries; as a result, Argentina style [[Asado]] a la cruz can be found in local fairs during summer.

===Emilia-Romagna===
[[Image:Parmigiano reggiano factory.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Parmesan cheese]]]]

[[Emilia-Romagna]] is well known for its egg pasta made with soft wheat flour, indeed it is the [[Pasta]] capital of the North.  [[Bologna]] is famous for many pasta dishes like [[tortellini]], [[lasagne verdi]], [[gramigna]] and [[tagliatelle]] which are found also in other towns of the region. In addition Romagna has [[Cappelletti]], [[Garganelli]] , [[Strozzapretti]] , [[Spoglia Lorda]] and [[Tortelli alla Lastra]]. In Emilia, from Parma to Piacenza, rice is also eaten  though to a lesser extent, as it is cultivated in the Po Valley. Polenta was historically the staple in all the Appenine mountain areas of both Emilia and Romagna. Centuries old products like authentic ''Aceto balsamico tradizionale'' or [[balsamic vinegar]] are made only in the Emilia towns of Modena and Reggio Emilia and Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale must be made following legally binding traditional procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 187.&lt;/ref&gt;Another centuries old product, [[Parmigiano Reggiano cheese]] is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena and Bologna and is much used in the cuisine. Though a lot of fish is eaten on the Adriatic coast, this is mainly a meat eating region and many different meats are eaten here including Romagna Lamb and Mora Romagnola Pork as well as game.  The region is also famous for its many excellent cured pork  products: Bologna, Parma and Modena hams, incuding Parma ''[[culatello]]'' and ''[[Salame Felino]]'' and Piacenza ''[[pancetta]]'' and ''[[coppa]]''.  It is also famous for cooked pork products like Bologna's [[mortadella]] and [[salame rosa]], Modena's [[zampone]], [[capello di prete]] and [[cotechino]] and Ferrara's [[salama da sugo]]''

===Tuscany===
[[Image:Truffle washed and cutted.jpg|thumb|right|125px|White truffle]]
Simplicity is popular in the cuisine in [[Tuscany]]. [[Legume]]s, [[bread]], [[cheese]], crisp [[vegetable]]s, [[mushroom]]s and fresh seasonal [[fruit]] are popular food items. [[Olive oil]] is an integral ingredient in Tuscany made from the Moraiolo, Leccino, Frantoio, and [[Pendolino]] olives. White [[truffle]]s from [[San Miniato]] are a distinct specialty that appear in October and November. [[Beef]] of the highest quality come from the Chiana Valley, specifically a breed known as [[Maremma]] used for the famed t-bone steaks known as [[Florentine steak]]. [[Pork]] is another integral protein to the Tuscan cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 221-239.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[List of Italian dishes#Tuscany|List of dishes unique to Tuscany]]

===Umbria===
[[Image:Truffle 4.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Black truffle]]s]]
Most of the dishes of [[Umbria]] are prepared with the simple techniques of boiling and roasting with the addition of local olive oil and herbs for flavor. [[Vegetable]] dishes are more popular in the spring and summer while they are in season, while the fall and winter introduces meats from the hunting season and [[black truffle]]s from [[Norcia]]. [[Sausage]] making is very popular in this region produced by the ''Norcini'' (Umbrian Butchers, native of [[Norcia]]). ''Lenticchie di Castelluccio'' are prized [[lentil]]s found in [[Castelluccio]] and are highly prized throughout Italy. The regions of [[Spoleto]] and Monteleone are known for their production of high-quality [[spelt]]. Freshwater [[fish]] are also found in the cuisine including [[lasca]], [[trout]], freshwater [[perch]], [[grayling]], [[eel]], [[barbel]], [[whitefish]], and [[tench]].&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 255, 256, 260, 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[List of Italian dishes#Umbria|List of dishes unique to Umbria]]

[[Image:Mortadella.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Mortadella]]]]
===Marche===
On the coast of [[Marche]], fresh fish and seafood proliferate. In the inland regions wild and domestic [[pig]]s are prized in the cuisine often making their way into [[sausage]]s, [[ham]]s and other skilled delicacies. Here instead the hams are not thinly sliced, but cut into bite-sized chunks when served. [[Suckling pig]], [[chicken]] and [[fish]] are often stuffed in this region before being roasted or placed on the spit.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 273&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[List of Italian dishes#Marche|List of dishes unique to Marche]]

===Lazio===
[[Image:Gnocchi with truffle.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Gnocchi]]]]
Hearty pasta dishes find their way into the cuisine of [[Lazio]], like the renowned [[amatriciana]] pasta dressing, based on spicy [[Chili pepper|red pepper]] and [[guanciale]]. The region prides itself on being able to use the lesser known cuts of pork and beef in tasty dishes, with examples in preparations like the entrail-based [[pajata]] and [[coda alla vaccinara]]. While these are memento to the ingenuity of plebeians and peasants having to make-do with little resources several other dishes are derived from the tables of Roman patricians, Popes and cardinals, thus relying on much more prized and valuable ingredients. Some [[Jewish]] influence can also be seen in the cuisine, with Jews having been part of Roman milieu since the 1st century BC. Local vegetables, especially [[globe artichoke]]s, are popular in the Roman cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[List of Italian dishes#Lazio|List of dishes unique to Lazio]]

===Abruzzo and Molise===
[[Image:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|left|125px|[[Saffron]]]]
[[Chili pepper|Chilies]] (''peperoncini'') are seen in the cuisine of [[Abruzzo]] where they are called ''diavoletti'' (&quot;little devils&quot;) for the spicy heat they add to dishes. ''[[Centerbe]]'' (&quot;Hundred Herbs&quot;) is a strong (72°), spicy herbal liqueur drunk by the local people here. [[Pasta]], [[meat]], and [[vegetable]]s are central to the cuisine of [[Abruzzo]] and [[Molise]]. [[Lamb and mutton|Lamb]] can be seen here often and is frequently and successfully combined with pasta. A special tool used to cut the local pasta is the ''chitarra'' (literally &quot;guitar&quot;), a fine stringed tool that the dough is pressed through. Another famous dish is ''arrosticini'', little pieces of castrated lamb, impaled on a wooden stick and cooked on coals, very famous in [[Pescara]]. [[Saffron]] is a favorite spice of the region, grown in the province of [[L'Aquila]], with the greatest production being done in the plains of [[Navelli]]. Although its popularity has  slightly waned in recent years it can still be seen in some dishes which are central to Italian cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[List of Italian dishes#Abruzzo and Molise|List of dishes unique to Abruzzo and Molise]]

===Campania===
[[Image:Authentic Neapolitan Pizza Marinara.jpg|thumb|right|125px|[[Pizza]] Napoletana]]
High-quality produce of [[Campania]] includes tomatoes, peppers, [[Scallion|spring onions]], potatoes, artichokes, fennel, lemons and oranges which all take on the unique flavor of the volcanic soil of the region. The [[Gulf of Naples]] offers top-quality fresh fish and seafood. [[Durum wheat]] is used in the production of the region's pastas. The mozzarella is highly prized here as it is of the highest quality coming from the milk of [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]]. The traditional pizzas of the region are extremely well known and take advantage of the fresh vegetables and cheese found there. Desserts are not to be overlooked, with [[pastiera]], [[sfogliatella|sfogliatelle]] and rum-dipped [[babà]] being the most famous ones.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of [[Italian-American cuisine]] is based on that of Campania as well as Sicily, heavily [[immigrant cuisine|Americanized]] to reflect different ingredients and living conditions in the United States. In addition, most forms of [[pizza]] eaten around the world derive ultimately from the Neapolitan style, though greatly modified over the course of the 20th century.

[[Image:Italian olive oil 2007.jpg|thumb|left|50px|[[Olive oil]]]]

===Puglia===
The northern portion of [[Puglia]] uses copious amounts of garlic and onion. The region is known for its dried pasta made from durum wheat flour. Fresh vegetables come in the way of tomatoes, zucchini, broccoli, bell peppers, potatoes, spinach, eggplants, cauliflower, fennel, [[Endive|Belgian endive]], as well as legumes such as chickpeas, lentils and beans. [[Apulia]] is the largest producer of [[olive oil]] in Italy. The closeness to the sea brings a proliferation of fish and seafood to the table, especially [[oyster]]s, and [[mussel]]s. Goat and lamb are seen on the table here occasionally as well.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 361.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[List of Italian dishes#Apulia|List of dishes unique to Apulia]]

===Basilicata===
[[Pork]] is an integral part of [[Basilicata]]'s cuisine, often made into sausages or roasted on a spit by home cooks. Mutton and lamb are also popular meats in the region. Pasta is another common ingredient to the cuisine here, made from duram wheat and water. The accompanying sauces for the pasta are generally of the meat or vegetable based variety. Spicy [[peperoncini]] are also popular in Basilicata. The bitter [[digestif]] ''Amaro Lucano'' is from this region, but is actually popular all over Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[List of Italian dishes#Basilicata|List of dishes unique to Basilicata]]

===Calabria===
[[Image:Melon.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Many varieties of [[melon]] proliferate in Calabria]]
The cuisine of [[Calabria]] has been highly affected by the constant conquerors and visitors of the region's past. The Arabs introduced oranges, lemons, raisins, artichokes and egg plants. [[Cistercian]] monks introduced [[Agriculture|agricultural practices]] to the region along with their skills in processing [[dairy product]]s. French rule under the [[House of Anjou]], and later [[Napoleon]], along with Spanish influence, affected the language and culinary skills as seen in the naming conventions of items such as cake, ''gatò'', from the French ''gateau''. In time the region has taken on its own characteristics and distinct regional cuisine based on these influences. Seafood proliferates in the cuisine due to its orientation to the coast line with [[swordfish]] being of note along with [[shrimp]], [[lobster]], [[sea urchin]], [[squid]] and others. [[Melon]]s also grow well in this region with [[watermelon]], charleston gray, crimson sweet, [[cantelope]], ''tendrale verde'', ''piel de sapo'' and ''invernale giallo'' being popularly served in a chilled ''Macedonia di frutta'' (fruit salad) or wrapped in [[Prosciutto]].&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 401.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sicily===
[[Image:Blood oranges.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Blood orange]] found in Sicily]]
{{Main|Cuisine of Sicily}}
[[Sicily]] is another region filled with culinary influences because of its location. The influence of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]]s can be found here: [[Dionysus]] has been said to have introduced wine to the region. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] later conquered the island and introduced lavish dishes based on [[goose]]. The [[Byzantines]] introduced sweet and sour flavors while during the 10th and 11th centuries the Arabs brought [[apricot]]s, [[sugar]], [[citrus]], sweet melons, [[rice]], [[saffron]], [[raisin]]s, [[nutmeg]], [[clove]], [[black pepper]], and [[cinnamon]] which are all still seen in the cuisine today. The [[Normans]] and [[Hohenstaufen]]s introduced a fondness for meat dishes. The [[Spain|Spanish]] introduced numerous items from the New World including [[cocoa]], [[maize]], [[turkey]], [[tomatoes]] and other produce items. [[Tuna]], [[sea bream]], [[sea bass]], [[cuttlefish]], [[swordfish]] and other seafood available off the coastline is an integral part of the modern cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 423.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[List of Italian dishes#Sicily|List of dishes unique to Sicily]]

===Sardinia===
[[Sardinia]] was a region once fought over fiercely by many powers, the coastal cuisine of fish and seafood has only flourished after much history had passed as the inhabitants of the region wisely kept away from the coastline so highly cherished by invading traders of the area. Today [[rock lobster]], [[scampi]], squid, tuna, sardines and other seafood and fish figure prominently into the cuisine. Suckling pig and [[Boar|wild boar]] figure prominently, often roasted on the spit or boiled in hearty stews of beans, vegetables and thickened with dry bread rounding out the meal. Fresh herbs such as mint and myrtle are popular in dishes as well. Sardinian bread is made in a drier format, which keeps longer than high-moisture breads as well, examples include ''civraxiu'', ''coccoi pinatus'', a highly decorative bread and ''pistoccu'' made with flour and water only, meant to travel distances with herders but served at home often with tomatoes, basil, oregano, garlic and a strong cheese.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 457, 460.&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[List of Italian dishes#Sardinia|List of dishes unique to Sardinia]]

==Meal structure==
Meals are structured in a cyclical order in Italy and invariably contain no fewer than 3-4 courses. Meals are seen as a time to spend with family and friends instead of immediate sustenance, as such the regular daily meals can be a bit longer than other cultures. During holidays, many family feasts will last for many hours, if not the entire day.

In many homes today the traditional Italian menu is kept for high days and special events (as weddings) while the everyday menu only includes the first and second course, the [[side dish]] and coffee. One notable aspect of an Italian meal, is that the ''primo'' or first course, is usually the more filling dish and will consist of either risotto or pasta, both being rich in [[carbohydrate]]s. Modern Italian cuisine also includes single courses (all-in-one courses), providing carbohydrates and proteins at the same time (e.g. pasta and legumes).

;''Aperitivo'': [[apéritif]] usually enjoyed as an appetizer before a large meal. Popular drinks include [[Campari]], [[Cinzano]], [[Prosecco]], [[Aperol]], [[Spritz]] and [[Vermouth]].
;''Antipasto'': literally &quot;before (the) meal&quot;, hot or cold [[appetizer]]s
;''Primo'': &quot;first course&quot;, usually consists of a hot dish like [[pasta]], [[risotto]], [[gnocchi]], [[polenta]] or [[soup]]. 
;''Secondo'': &quot;second course&quot;, the main dish, usually fish or meat. Traditionally veal, pork and chicken  are the most commonly used meat, at least in the North, though beef has become more popular since [[World War II]] and wild game is very popular, particularly in [[Tuscany]]. Fish are those which are caught locally.  
;''Contorno'': &quot;side dish&quot;, may consist of a salad or cooked vegetables. A traditional menu features salad along with the main course.
;''Formaggio'' ''e'' ''frutta'': &quot;cheese and fruits&quot;, the first dessert. Local Cheeses may also be part of the ''Antipasto'' or ''Contorno'' as well.
;''Dolce'': &quot;dessert&quot;, such as cakes and cookies
;''Caffè'': coffee
;''Digestivo'': &quot;digestives&quot;, liquors/liqueurs ([[grappa]], [[amaro (drink)|amaro]], [[limoncello]],[[sambuca]],[[nocino]]) sometimes referred to as ''[[ammazzacaffè]]'' (&quot;coffee killer&quot;)

Note: On restaurant menus, these terms may be referred to as Primi, Secondi, Contorni, and Digestivi (included here as search terms).

==Dining out==
[[Image:Italian trattoria sign.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Trattoria]]]]
Italy offers many options for dining out or getting a drink. Each type of establishment has a defined role and traditionally sticks to it.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 198-200.&lt;/ref&gt;  Below is a listing of various dining and drinking establishments one might find in Italy.

'''Places to dine out'''
*[[Agriturismo]] - Working farms that often offer accommodations and meals.  Often the meals are served to guests only. Marked by green and gold sign with a knife and fork on it.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bar (establishment)|Bar]]/Caffé - Popular locations which serve coffee, [[soft drink]]s, juice and alcohol.  Traditional hours are from 6am to 10pm.  Common foods sold include [[brioche]], [[panini]], [[tramezzini]] or [[spuntini]] (snacks) which can include [[olive]]s, [[Potato chip|potato crisps]] and small pieces of [[frittata]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Birreria - A bar that offers beer found in central and northern regions of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Frasca/Locanda - [[Friulian]] wine producers that often open for the evening and many stay open late offering food along with their wines.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Osteria - Focused on simple food of the local region, usually only having a verbal menu. Many are open at night only but some open for lunch from 12:30 to 3pm. They will then reopen at 7pm for dinner with a late closing time.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 201.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Paninoteca - Sandwich specialty shop open during the day.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 201.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pizzeria]] - Wood fired pizzas are a specialty of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 203&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Restaurant|Ristorante]] - Often offers upscale cuisine with more refinement along with printed menus.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 203&lt;/ref&gt;
*Spaghetteria - Originating in [[Napoli]], offering pasta dishes and other main courses.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 204.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tavola Calda - Literally &quot;hot table&quot;, offers pre-made regional dishes ordered from a queue, often served on a tray. Most open at 11am and close late.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 205&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Trattoria]] - A dining establishment often family run with inexpensive prices and an informal atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coffee==
[[Image:Linea doubleespresso.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Espresso]]
{{see also|espresso}}
[[Image:Coffee Moka.JPG|thumb|left|150px|''Moka per il caffè'']]
Italian style coffee (''caffè''), also known as [[espresso]] is made from the same coffee beans as any other style of coffee. However, beans prepared for espresso are usually roasted dark, and are often a blend of coffee beans of various origins. In Italy though, the espresso is roasted medium to medium dark in the North, and gets darker as one moves South, though throughout all of Italy a very prominent coffee in the blends are Brazilian coffees. Common misconception is that espresso contains more caffeine than coffee but the opposite is true. The longer roasting period for the beans extracts more of the caffeine and thus giving espresso roast beans less caffeine content. The modern [[espresso machine]] invented in 1937 by Achille Gaggia uses a pump and pressure system with water heated up to 90-95°C (194-203°F) and forced with high pressure through a few grams of finely ground espresso roast beans with a pressure of nine bars in 25-30 seconds resulting in about 25 milliliters or two tablespoons of liquid.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 300.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Home espresso makers are much more simplistic, but work under the same principle. ''La Napoletana'' is a four part stove-top unit with grounds placed inside a filter loosely, the kettle portion is filled with water and once boiling, the unit is inverted to drip through the grounds. The ''Moka per il caffè'' is a three part stove-top unit that is placed on the stove-top with loosely packed grounds in a strainer, the water rises from steam pressure, and is forced through the grounds into the top portion. It is unlike a percolator in that the brewed coffee is not re-circulated.&lt;ref&gt;Piras, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is usually served in a [[demitasse]] in relatively small quantity. [[Caffè macchiato]] is a topped with a bit of steamed milk or foam; [[ristretto]] is made with less water, and is stronger; [[cappuccino]] is mixed or topped with steamed, mostly frothy, milk. It is generally considered a morning beverage; [[caffelatte]] is generally equal parts espresso and steamed milk, similar to [[café au lait]], and is typically served in a large cup. [[Latte macchiato]] (spotted milk) is a glass of warm milk with a bit of coffee.

==Wine==
[[Image:DOCG.jpg|thumb|right|150px|DOCG label on wine bottle]]
{{main article|Italian wine}}
Italy produces the largest amount of wine in the world. It is also the largest exporter and consumer of wine as well. Two-thirds of the wine produced is bulk wine used for blending in [[France]] and [[Germany]]. The amount of wine distilled into spirits in Italy exceeds the production of wine in the entirety of the [[New World]]. As seen, although Italy produces the largest amount of wine in the world, approximately 25% of it is of quality that is labeled and put into bottles for individual sale.&lt;ref&gt;Koplan, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fine wine is made in most regions of Italy. Much like the variety of regional cuisines of Italy, the wines are extremely varied as well with twenty separate wine regions.&lt;ref&gt;Koplan, 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

The top wines in Italy are highly appealing and are generally extremely food-friendly wines. Those producing great wines have been attempting to wash away the old image of jug wines so often associated with [[Italian wine]] production. In order to promote this process the Italian government created a number of laws to regulate the wine industry. The ''[[Denominazione di Origine Controllata]]'' ([[Denominazione di origine controllata|DOC]]) law passed in 1963 regulates the place of origin. The laws associate with DOC have been regularly updated. One of the updates in 1980, created the ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata|Denominiazione di Origine Controllatta e Garantita]]'' ([[DOCG]]).  DOCG is reserved for only the best wines in Italy.  These laws regulate place of origin, quality, production methods and the type of grape used to produce the wine. The designation of ''[[Indicazione Geografica Tipica]]'' (IGT) is a slightly less restrictive designation regulating place which is considered to help a wine maker graduate to the (DOC) level.&lt;ref&gt;Koplan, 307-308.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holiday cuisine==
Italians celebrate each holiday with a different cuisine, each in turn having a specific meaning. Moreover every single region has its own dedicated holiday recipes, having preserved them along centuries of political division which lasted until the 19th century. In [[Sicily]] and other Italian communities worldwide, on March 19, [[La Festa di San Giuseppe]] ([[St. Joseph's Day]]), thanks are given to [[St. Joseph]] for preventing a famine in Sicily during the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[fava bean]] was the crop which saved the population from starvation, and is a traditional part of St. Joseph's Day altars and traditions. Other customs celebrating this festival include wearing red clothing, eating Sicilian pastries known as [[zeppole]] and giving food to the needy.

On [[Christmas Eve]] a symbolic fast is observed (the so-called &quot;cena di magro&quot;, the &quot;light dinner&quot;) excluding beef, pork and [[Lamb (food)|lamb meat]] and including many courses based mainly on fish and other seafood, but also on snails and frogs. On [[Christmas]] Italians often serve [[tortellini]] as a first course. The typical cakes of the Christmas season are [[panettone]] and [[pandoro]], with people often being partial to one but not the other.On [[Easter|Easter Sunday]], lamb-based dishes are commonly served throughout both northern and southern Italy.

The '''Cockatiel''' (''Nymphicus hollandicus''), also known as the '''Quarrion''' and the '''Weero''', is a diminutive [[cockatoo]] [[Endemism in birds|endemic]] to [[Australia]] and prized as a household [[pet]]. They are relatively easy to breed and keep in captivity and they are kept throughout the world as pets.

The only member of the [[genus]] '''''Nymphicus''''', the Cockatiel has previously been considered a crested parrot or small cockatoo. However, more recent molecular studies have settled the debate, showing their closest relatives to be the black cockatoos of the genus ''[[Calyptorhynchus]]''. They are hence now classified as the smallest of the [[Cacatuidae]] (cockatoo family). Cockatiels are natively found across the outback regions of inland Australia, and favour the Australian wetlands, scrublands, and bush lands.

==Taxonomy==
The Cockatiel was originally described by Scottish writer and naturalist [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792 as ''Psittacus hollandicus'', before being placed in its own genus ''Nymphicus'' by  [[Johann Georg Wagler|Wagler]] in 1832. Placed in its own genus, the Cockatiel's scientific name ''Nymphicus hollandicus'' reflects the experience of one of the earliest groups of [[Europe]]ans to see Cockatiels in their native [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. Travelers thought they were so beautiful that they named them after mythical [[nymphs]]. (''Nymphicus'' literally means &quot;little nymph.&quot;) The species name refers to [[New Holland]], an old name for Australia.

Its biological relationship had long been disputed; it is placed into a [[monotypic]] [[subfamily]] Nymphicinae but had sometimes in the past been included among the [[Platycercinae]], the broad-tailed Parakeets. This issue has now been settled with molecular studies. [[mtDNA|Mitochondrial]] 12S [[rRNA]] [[DNA sequence|sequence]] data&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D.M. &amp; Toft, C.A. (1999): Molecular systematics and biogeography of the cockatoos (Psittaciformes: ''Cacatuidae''). Auk 116(1): 141-157. &lt;/ref&gt; places it amongst the [[Calyptorhynchinae]] (dark cockatoos) [[subfamily]]. The unique, [[Parakeet]] morphological feature is a consequence of the decrease in size and accompanying change of [[ecological niche]].&lt;!-- Despite the latter unique adaptation, the dark plumage and dimorphic features (differences between males and females) and the recent accidental hybridization of a hen Cockatiel with a cock ''Eolophus roseicapillus'' (Galah, also known as the rose-breasted Cockatoo) producing a healthy (though likely sterile) offspring are all clear morphological indications of the Cockatiel Parakeet belonging among the ''[[Calyptorhynchinae]]'' (dark Cockatoo) Subfamily. --&gt;

Sequence analysis of [[intron]] 7 of the [[nuclear DNA|nuclear]] ''?''-[[fibrinogen]] gene, on the other hand, indicates that it may yet be distinct enough as to warrant recognition of the Nymphicinae rather than inclusion of the genus in the [[Calyptorhynchinae]].&lt;ref&gt;Astuti, Dwi (2004): A phylogeny of Cockatoos (Aves: Psittaciformes) inferred from DNA sequences of the seventh intron of Nuclear ?-fibrinogen gene. Doctoral work, Graduate School of Environmental Earth Science, Hokkaido University, Japan.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cockatiel Parakeet (Parakeet meaning long-tailed Parrot) is now biologically classified as a genuine member of ''[[Cacatuidae]]'' on account of sharing all of the Cockatoo family's biological features. Namely; the erectile crest, a [[gallbladder]], [[powder down]], suppressed cloudy-layer (enabling Lories, Lorikeets (long-tailed Lories), Parakeets and typical Parrot species display of structural colours such as aquas, blues, greens, purples and turquoises), and facial feathers covering the sides of the beak, all of which are rarely found outside the ''Cacatuidae'' family.

==Portrayal==
[[Image:Brehms Tierleben Cockatiels.jpg|thumb|left|1927 [[Brehms Tierleben]] painting]]
The Cockatiel's distinctive erectile [[crest (bird)|crest]] expresses the animal's state of being. (Some say &quot;emotional state.&quot;) The crest is dramatically vertical when the cockatiel is startled or excited, gently oblique in its neutral or relaxed state, and flattened close to the head when the animal is angry or defensive. The crest is also held flat but protrudes outward in the back when the cockatiel is trying to appear alluring or flirtatious. In contrast to most Cockatoos, the Cockatiel has long tail feathers roughly making up half of its total length. At 300 mm to 330 mm (12 to 13 ins), the Cockatiel is the smallest and only parakeet type of Cockatoo species. The latter ranging between 300 [[Millimetre|mm]] to 600 mm (12-24 in) in length.

The &quot;Normal Grey,&quot; or &quot;Wild-type&quot; cockatiel's plumage is primarily grey with prominent white flashes on the outer edges of each wing. The face of the male is yellow or white, while the face of the female is primarily grey or light grey, and both genders feature a round orange area on both ear areas, often referred to as &quot;cheek patches.&quot; This orange colouration is generally vibrant in adult males, and often quite muted in females. Visual sexing is often possible with this variant of the bird.

==Distribution and habitat==
Cockatiels are native only to Australia where they are found largely in [[arid]] or [[semi-arid]] country, but always near water. Sometimes hundreds will flock around a single such body of water. To farmers' dismay, they often eat cultivated crops. They are absent from the most fertile southwest and southeast corners of the country, the deepest [[Western Australia]]n deserts, and [[Cape York Peninsula]]. They are the only Cockatoo [[species]] which can sometimes reproduce in the end of their first year.

==Lifespan==
The Cockatiel's lifespan in captivity is generally given as 15-20 years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cockatielcottage.net/basics.html cockatielcottage.net]&lt;/ref&gt; though it is sometimes given as short as 10-15 years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letstalkbirds.com/cockatiels.htm letstalkbirds.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and there are reports of Cockatiels living as long as 30 years, the oldest confirmed specimen reported being 35 years old when it died. A cockatiel lived to be 27 years old in Manchester, UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.petlovers.com/vb/archive/index.php/t-451.html Petlovers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|lifespan 35?|date=March 2008}} Diet and exercise, much like in humans, are often major determining factors in cockatiel lifespan. Again, breeders dispute the best diet for increasing the longevity of the cockatiel lifespan.

{{howto}}
Cockatiels are generally regarded as good pets having a &quot;sweet&quot; demeanor, though this is by no means a guarantee. Like most other pets, the manner in which the animal is raised, handled, and kept has a profound effect on the temperament of the animal. Some birds are quite gregarious and sociable while others can be shy, retreating to the back of the cage when an unfamiliar figure appears.

Generally, well-socialised birds are gentle and friendly. Some cockatiels enjoy physical contact, lending themselves well to taming. Many cockatiel owners develop regular bonding rituals with their animals, engaging in preening, scratching, and even petting. Cockatiels which are hand-fed and purchased from a young age are more readily suited for physical contact.

Some birds will emit a distinctive &quot;hiss&quot; when irritated, retreating rapidly or defending with pecking bites, which can be relatively strong for their size. This &quot;hiss&quot; is a form of mimicry used in a defensive attempt to confuse the cockatiel's most common predator, the snake.{{Fact|date=July 2008}}

Cockatiels do have a reputation for being quite noisy and demanding of the attention of their owners on a regular basis. Their vocalisations range from ginger cheeps to piercing cries.

They can be made more secure (in the mood for singing/mimicry, playing, etc) when they have a consistent few hours of quality time per day with a person or in a person's company and a good night's sleep. Twelve hours of sleep at least is required for a happy pet, sleep taken away can cause sickness and grumpy pets.  If left of their own, quiet birds will frequently make contact calls with their owners, calls that sometimes can be quite loud if the person is out of sight. Cockatiels can grow so attached to their owners that they may try to 'protect' them from anyone that tries to come near them, such as a partner or family member, by biting or hissing. This happens especially if cockatiels are kept in bedrooms or other rooms that are not generally shared by everyone in the family, because cockatiels perceive those rooms as their own personal territory.  By keeping cockatiels in a shared household room, they are exposed to all family members equally and will not favour one person and feel the need to defend him or her as much.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.birdtricks.com/cockatiel-cages.html)&lt;/ref&gt; Cockatiels must be acquainted with the entire family, in order to assure even temperament toward all. A scared cockatiel will choose flight over fight most of the time, thus creating a chance for injury (i.e. flying into a glass door). Their popularity as pets is in part because of their calm and timid [[temperament]], to the point that they can even be bullied by smaller but more confident birds such as [[Budgerigars]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Budgerigars and other smaller birds may choose to pick at cockatiels' feet causing lost toes.  It is not uncommon at all for a larger or smaller bird to maim the cockatiel, creating life-long disabilities and potentially life threatening injuries. However, some cockatiels will defend themselves.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Cockatiels don't necessarily make good pets for young children because they startle easily with loud or unexpected sounds and can bite out of fear of sudden hand movements near and above their heads. The shoulders of children are small and unstable perches compared with those of adults, and forcing the bird to use an uncomfortable place to stand may lead to the bird disliking the child. {{Fact|date=August 2007}} Once bonded with their owners, they will often cuddle and play, pushing their head against hands or faces, and may nibble at fingers for attention to get a scratch on the head and neck.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} Cockatiels, like almost all other parrots, love to chew paper and can destroy objects (like cardboard, books, magazines, wicker baskets, etc) left unattended.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.birdtricks.com/cockatiel-common-problems.html)&lt;/ref&gt; Most cockatiels enjoy looking at themselves in mirrors and will engage in the activity for hours. Cockatiels that are exposed to mirrors perceive their reflections as their mates. This can induce very aggressive behaviour, and upon seeing themselves once, they are likely to experience anxiety until they find the mirror again.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.cockatielcottage.net/questions3.html)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

[[Image:TripleMutationCockatiel.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Cockatiel specimen combining the Opaline (cka Pearled) and ADMpied (cka recessive pied) mutations]]
The Cockatiel, along with the [[Budgerigar]], is among the most popular pet bird species. Today all Cockatiels available in the pet trade are captive-bred, as Australia no longer permits the export of native wildlife, whether [[Endangered species|endangered]] or not{{Specify|date=December 2006}}. 

===Vocalisation===
Although cockatiels are part of the ''[[Psittaciformes|parrot order]]'', they are better at imitating whistles than speech. Although they can learn words, the only understandable parts of the words are the inflections, while the consonants are not easily discernible. Their whistles and other mimicking sounds such as 'lip-smacking' and 'tutting' are almost perfect imitations of the sounds their owners make. {{Specify|date=December 2006}}. Although some cockatiels do learn to repeat phrases, males are generally better at mimicry than females.{{Specify|date=December 2006}} Cockatiel speech often comes out as a &quot;whistle&quot; when they do annunciate, the voice being soft in volume and difficult to make out. Cockatiels can mimic many sounds, such as the bleep of a [[car alarm]], a ringing [[telephone]], the sound of a zipper, the beeping of cell phones or microwaves, or the calls of other bird species such as [[blue jay]]s or [[Titmouse|chickadees]] and loud weather like [[thunder]]. They can also mimic other pets such as dogs, occasionally barking back.

Although some say that female cockatiels cannot speak, this is not an absolute. Males have been known to mimic noises, words and sometimes other animals. Females generally don't imitate speech, but tend to mimic sounds such as telephones, washing machines, toilet flushes, etc. {{Fact|date=November 2007}} Cockatiels that do imitate speech will usually mimic frequently heard phrases, particularly of the individual to whom the bird feels closest.

===Breeding===
[[Image:Cockatiel egg.jpg|right|thumb|A cockatiel egg with [[centimetre]] scale]]
[[Image:Babyvalkparkiet.JPG|thumb|A Cockatiel chick]]
Cockatiels are a popular choice for amateur parrot breeders along with [[budgerigar]]s. This is due to both the ease of getting the birds to breed (they seem to have no inhibitions, with both genders engaging in [[Non-human animal sexual behavior|self-stimulation]]) and the fairly low cost of the equipment needed. Generally a clutch consists of 4-5 eggs, each approximately the size of one's thumbnail. Eggs are laid once every two days and incubate for 18-22 days. Hatchlings fledge between 4-5 weeks old and wean between 8-10 weeks old. Puberty (adolescence) is reached around 9 months of age while adulthood is reached around 1 year and 9 months in males and/or 15-18 months in females.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cockatiels.org/articles/breeding/breedingStarting.html Cockatiels.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Male cockatiels are very protective and nurturing of their offspring and are known to be very capable of raising their newborns if the mother is unable to.

Some female cockatiels also lay eggs without fertilization, much as those of the [[chicken]] species used for food production. In this event, the owner should leave the eggs alone until the bird stops sitting on them, after which the eggs can be removed. To prevent laying, one can keep the cockatiel in more darkness per day by covering it earlier in the evening and leaving the cage covered longer in the morning. Like all parrots, cockatiels of either gender can grow to see their owner or a toy as a mate, engage in courtship and mating behavior including territoriality, and females may lay infertile eggs.&lt;ref&gt; [http://rationalparrot.com/tease.html How Not to be a Tease: Discouraging mating behaviors in parrots], 17 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested by some breeders that petting the back of the female cockatiel may inadvertently sexually stimulate the hen, promoting egg-laying, and that owners seeking to avoid egg-laying should avoid this particular form of bonding.

The Cockatiel has recently been shown to be capable of [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridising]] with the [[Galah]], producing offspring described by the media as 'Galatiels'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkingbirds.com.au/worldfirst-galah.php Talking Birds - Australia's Avian Newspaper&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour mutations===
{{main|Cockatiel colour genetics}}
About fifteen primary [[mutation]]s have been established in the species and enable the production of many different combinations.

Note : 
aka stands for also-known-as, 
cka stands for commonly-known-as
ika stands for incorrectly-known-as

* ADMpied (aka Recessive Pied aka Harlequin)
* Ashenfallow (ika Recessive silver)
* Bronzefallow (cka Brownfallow)
* Cinnamon
* Dilute (ika Pastel Silver)
* Dominant silver (aka Ashen Dilute)
* Edged dilute (ika Spangled ika spangled silver)
* Faded
* SL Ino 
* NSLino (Recessive Ino)
* Opaline (cka Pearled)
* Palefaced (ika Pastelface)
* Platinum (ika Pallid)
* Whitefaced (same gene as genuine Blue mutation in typical Parrot and Parakeet species)
* Dominant and Sex Linked Yellowcheeked
* Yellow-suffused (ika Emerald, or Olive)

The multiple names for these mutations is due in part to different regions of the globe naming the same colour change a different term. This does not mean that it is a different mutation. It only means it is a different name.

Colour [[mutation]]s are a natural phenomenon equally occurring in captivity and in the wild.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Moving''' or '''relocating''' is the process of vacating fixed location (such as a residence or business) and settling in a different one. A move can be to a nearby location within the same neighborhood, a much farther location in a different city, or sometimes a different country. Depending on the circumstances, it can be a happy or unhappy occasion for the person who is moving. On the [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale]], change of residence is considered a stressful activity, assigned 20 points (with death of spouse being ranked the highest at 100)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/beyond_stretched/holmes.htm The Holmes-Rahe Scale&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Reasons==
There are various reasons why people move to a different residence. These include:
*The need or desire for a larger residence
*The need or desire for a [[house]] versus an [[apartment]]
*Change in neighborhood conditions
*To be closer to one's [[job (role)|job]]
*Change of jobs to one that is in a much farther location
*To seek a job or [[career]] in a new city
*To be closer to one's family
*To be near an institution where one is receiving an education
*A child reaching adulthood and leaving his/her parents' home
*[[Marriage]] (or the formation of a [[domestic partnership]])
*[[Divorce]] (or [[legal separation]])
*Distancing from a person with whom one is fearful or otherwise dislikes
*In hard economic times, to be in a more affordable dwelling
*[[Eviction]] or [[foreclosure]]
*To be in a different [[climate]] where one feels more comfortable
*[[Retirement]]
*In [[old age]], to be in a dwelling requiring less maintenance or care
*[[Immigration]] to a different country
*Escape from an oppressive government

The '''Mars Science Laboratory''' ('''MSL''') is a [[NASA]] [[rover (space exploration)|rover]] scheduled to  be launched in [[September 15]], [[2009]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html NASA's Shuttle and Rocket Missions]&lt;/ref&gt; and perform the first ever precision landing on [[Mars]] in July-September of [[2010]]. This rover will be three times as heavy and twice the width of the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s (MERs) that landed in 2004. It will carry more advanced scientific instruments than any other mission to Mars to date, including analysis of samples scooped up from the [[soil]] and drilled powders from [[rock (geology)|rocks]]. It will also investigate the past or present ability of Mars to support [[life]]. The international community will provide some of the instruments onboard. 

The MSL rover will be launched by an [[Atlas V rocket|Atlas V 541]]. MSL will be expected to operate for at least 1 [[Timekeeping on Mars|martian year]] (668 Martian [[Solar time|sols]]/686 Earth [[day|days]]) as it explores with greater range than any previous Mars rover. 

== History ==
In September 2006, MSL was approved by NASA HQ for a 2009 launch. Several [[JPL]] engineers working on MSL have informally stated that the MSL design will likely be used on future rovers after the first MSL is launched in 2009.

In April 2008, ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that the project is $235 million, or 24%, over budget. The money to compensate this overrun should come from other NASA Mars missions, meaning a significant cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Specifications ==
[[Image:28936main rover-metric.jpg|thumb|240px|A comparison of sizes for the [[Sojourner (rover)|Sojourner rover]], the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s, the [[Phoenix Lander]] and the [[Mars Science Laboratory]].]]
MSL is expected to weigh over 800 [[kilogram|kg]] (1,760 [[pound (mass)|lb]]) including 65 kg (143 lb) of scientific instruments, compared to the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s which weigh 185 kg (407 lb) including 5 kg (11 lb) of scientific instruments. MSL will be able to roll over obstacles approaching 75 [[centimeter|cm]] (29 in) in height. Maximum terrain-traverse speed is estimated to be 90 [[Metre|m]] (295 ft) per hour via automatic navigation, however, average traverse speeds will likely be about 30 m/h (98 ft/h), based on variables including power levels, difficulty of the terrain, slippage, and visibility. MSL is expected to traverse a minimum of 6&amp;nbsp;km (3.7 mi) in its two-year mission.

== Proposed scientific payload ==
At present 10 instruments have been selected for development or production for MSL: 

=== Cameras (MastCam, MAHLI, MARDI) ===
All cameras are being developed by [[Malin Space Science Systems]]; all share common design components such as on-board electronic imaging processing boxes and 1600x1200 color [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]s.

*'''MastCam''': This system will provide multiple spectra and true color imaging with two-camera [[stereoscopic]] (three-[[dimension]]al) vision. True-color are at 1200x1200 [[pixels]] and up to 10 frames per second hardware-compressed, high-definition video at 1280x720.  For comparison the [[Mars Exploration Rover| Mars Exploration Rover (MER)]] panoramic cameras can only produce 1024x1024 black&amp;white images. The same filter wheel design for multiple spectra images from MER will be used on MastCam. Both cameras will have mechanical zoom and can image objects as far away as 1 [[kilometre|km]] at a resolution of 10 [[Metre#SI multiples|cm]] per pixel.

*'''Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI)''': This system will consist of a camera mounted to a robotic arm on the rover. It will be used to acquire microscopic images of rock and soil, like the microscopic imager (MI) on MER. Unlike the MI, MAHLI will take true color images at 1600x1200 pixels with a resolution as high as 12.5 [[micrometre|micrometers]] per pixel. MAHLI will have both white and UV [[LED]] illumination for imaging in darkness or imaging [[fluorescence]]. MAHLI will also have mechanical focusing in a range from [[infinite]] to [[millimeter|mm]] distances.

*'''MSL Mars Descent Imager (MARDI)''': During the descent to the Martian surface MARDI will take approximately 500 color images at 1600x1200 pixels starting at distances of about 3.7&amp;nbsp;km to near 5 [[meter]]s from the ground. MARDI imaging will allow the mapping of surrounding terrain and location of landing. On [[September 16]], [[2007]] NASA announced that MARDI would not be included in the MSL mission due to funding problems.&lt;ref name=SepMemo&gt;

=== ChemCam ===
ChemCam is a remote [[Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy]] (LIBS) system that can target a rock from up to 13 meters away, vaporizing a small amount of the underlying mineral and then collecting a spectrum of the light emitted by the vaporized rock by using a micro-imaging camera with an angular resolution of 80 [[microradian]]s. It is being developed by the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] and the French CESR laboratory (in charge of the laser). A infrared laser with 1067 nm wavelength and a 5 ns pulse will focus on a spot with 1 GW/cm², depositing 30 mJ of energy.  Detection will be done between 240 nm and 800 nm.&lt;ref&gt;

In October 2007 NASA announced that they would cap funding for the ChemCam because of a 70% cost overrun and that the instrument has to be built with the money already provided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=3625948 NASA Caps Funding for Mars Rover Sensor]&lt;/ref&gt; Since most of the money for ChemCam came from the French CNES, The Los Alamos National Laboratory was able to deliver the engineering model to JPL in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libs.lanl.gov/ChemCam_status.html ChemCam Status April, 2008 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alpha-particle X-ray spectrometer ([[APXS]]) ===
This device will irradiate samples with [[alpha particles]] and map the spectra of [[X-ray]]s that are reemitted.  It is being developed by the [[Canadian Space Agency]] for determining the elemental composition of samples. The APXS is a form of [[PIXE]]. Similar instruments have been part of [[Mars Pathfinder]] and the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The new Athena alpha particle X-ray spectrometer for the Mars Exploration Rovers|author= R.

=== Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) ===
The SAM instrument suite will analyze organics and gases from both atmospheric and solid samples.  It is being developed by the NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] and Laboratoire Inter-Universitaire des Systèmes Atmosphériques (LISA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD)===
This instrument will characterize the broad spectrum of radiation found near the surface of Mars for purposes of determining the viability and shielding needs for human explorers. Funded by the [[Exploration Systems Mission Directorate]] at NASA Headquarters and developed by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and the extraterrestrial physics group at Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel, Germany.

=== Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN)===
A pulsed neutron source and detector for measuring hydrogen or ice and water at or near the martian surface, provided by the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]]. 

=== Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) === 
Meteorological package and an ultraviolet sensor provided by the [[Spanish Government|Spanish Ministry of Education and Science]]. It will be mounted on the camera mast and measure atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind currents and direction, air and ground temperature and ultraviolet radiation levels.

=== MSL Entry Descent and Landing Instrumentation (MEDLI)===
The MEDLI project’s main objective is to measure aerothermal environments, sub-surface heat shield
material response, vehicle orientation, and atmospheric density for the atmospheric entry through the
sensible atmosphere down to heatshield separation of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) entry vehicle.
The MEDLI instrumentation suite will be installed in the heatshield of the MSL entry vehicle. The
acquired data will support future Mars missions by providing measured atmospheric data to validate Mars
atmosphere models and clarify the design margins on future Mars missions. MEDLI instrumentation
consists of three main subsystems: MEDLI Integrated Sensor Plugs (MISP), Mars Entry Atmospheric Data
System (MEADS), and the Sensor Support Electronics (SSE).

== Engineering cameras ==
The rover will have the same type of engineering cameras that the MER rovers had, a stereo pair of Navcams used to select safe routes for driving and a set of front and rear stereo-pair [[Hazcam]]s used for autonomous hazard avoidance during rover drives and for safe positioning of the robotic arm on rocks and soils.

== Power source ==
[[Image:MSLRoverConfig2 vs MER.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Conceptual drawing of the Mars Science Laboratory in operation on Mars, and size comparison to [[Mars Exploration Rover]], updated version]]

The rover will be powered by [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s (RTGs). [[Solar power]] is not an efficient power source for Mars surface operations.  Solar power systems cannot operate effectively at high Martian latitudes, in shaded areas, nor in dusty conditions. This limitation was emphasized by the July 2007 dust storms that nearly resulted in the permanent failure of the [[Mars Exploration Rovers]]. Furthermore, solar power cannot provide power at night, thus limiting the ability of the rover to keep its systems warm, reducing the [[life expectancy]] of electronics. RTGs can provide reliable, continuous power day and night, and waste heat can be used via pipes to warm systems, freeing electrical power for the operation of the vehicle and instruments. 

The first successful Mars landers, [[Viking 1]] and [[Viking 2]] in 1976, were RTG-powered—the Viking 1 lander worked for six years on the Martian surface (ultimately failing due to faulty command sent by ground control that resulted in loss of contact). The proposed power plant will use &quot;next generation&quot; RTGs, either [[Boeing]]’s Multi-mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator, which is a more flexible and compact power system under development and based on conventional RTGs, or [[Lockheed Martin]]’s [[Stirling Radioisotope Generator]], which is more efficient but untested for use in space. Evidence points to the MMRTG being selected at this point, likely because of reliability and underdevelopment issues with the SRG.

== Landing system ==
MSL will be set down on the Martian surface using a new NASA high-precision entry, descent, and landing (EDL) system that will place it within ten [[kilometer]]s of an intended target, in contrast to the 150-kilometer error of previous landing systems used on Mars. The rover is folded up within an [[aeroshell]] which protects it during the travel through space and during the [[atmospheric reentry|atmospheric entry]] at Mars.  Much of the reduction of the landing precision error is accomplished by an entry guidance algorithm, similar to that used by the astronauts returning to Earth in the [[Apollo space program]].  This guidance uses the lifting force experienced by the aeroshell to &quot;fly out&quot; any detected error in range and thereby arrive at the targeted landing site. In order for the aeroshell to have lift, its center of mass is offset from the axial centerline which results in an off-center trim angle in atmospheric flight, again similar to the [[Apollo Command Module]]. This is accomplished by a series of ejectable ballast mass. The lift vector is controlled by four sets of two [[Reaction Control System]] (RCS) thrusters that produce approximately 500&amp;nbsp;[[Newton|N]] of thrust per pair. This ability to change the pointing of the direction of lift allows the spacecraft to react to the ambient environment, and steer toward the landing zone.

After the entry phase is complete and the capsule has slowed to [[Mach number|Mach]] 2 several kilometers over the ground, a supersonic [[parachute]] is deployed.  The parachute is similar in design to that used by the Viking landers, Mars Pathfinder, and the Mars Exploration Rovers. The entry vehicle must first eject the ballast mass such that the [[center of gravity]] offset is removed and the velocity vector aligns with the parachute deployment vector. This prevents the spacecraft from experiencing a [[torque]] due to the pointing differences and increases the spacecraft's stability. 

Following the parachute deployment, the rover and descent stage drop out of the aeroshell. A number of passive mechanisms are used to ensure a clean separation. The descent stage is a platform above the rover with variable thrust mono propellant [[hydrazine]] rocket thrusters (based on upgraded [[Viking program|Viking]] heritage landing rockets) on arms extending around this platform to slow the descent. Meanwhile the rover itself is being transformed from its stowed flight configuration to a landing configuration while being lowered beneath the descent stage by the &quot;sky crane&quot; system. The descent stage contains the Bridle Umbilical Descent Rate Limiter (BUDrl) which is a next generation design based on [[Mars Exploration Rover|MER]] heritage. This consists of 3 bridles lowering the rover itself and an umbilical cable carrying electrical signals between the descent stage and rover.  At roughly 7.5 meters below the descent stage the sky crane system slows to a halt and the rover touches down.

After the rover touches down it waits 2 seconds to confirm that it is on solid ground and fires several [[pyrotechnics|pyros]] (small explosive devices) activating cable cutters on the bridle and umbilical cords to free itself from the descent stage.  The descent stage promptly flies away to a crash landing, and the rover gets ready to roam Mars.

Early landing system proposals for the rover featured a &quot;pallet&quot; design (similar to that used for Mars Pathfinder and the Mars Exploration Rovers) with a liquid-fueled [[rocket]] thruster system to land the rover in the final seconds of descent. The pallet would have used [[airbag]]s or a &quot;crushable&quot; design to permit a safe landing.  Earlier designs also sometimes included a second parachute for subsonic speeds.  The planned &quot;skycrane&quot; powered descent landing system (as it has been referred) has never been used in actual missions before.

== Proposed landing sites ==
At the first MSL Landing Site workshop, 33 potential landing sites were identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  The current engineering constraints call for a landing site less than 45° from the Martian equator and less than 1&amp;nbsp;km above the reference [[datum (geodesy)|datum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

By the second workshop in late 2007, the list had grown to include almost 50 sites. These sites were presented in more detail at the Second MSL Landing Site Workshop,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marsoweb.nas.nasa.gov/landingsites/msl2009/workshops/2nd_workshop/2nd_announcement.html |title=Second MSL Landing Site Workshop}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the list was reduced to six based on the votes of the members of the science community that were present as well as the votes of the science working group (the PI's of the instruments aboard MSL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/HiBlog/?p=131 |title=Reconnaissance of MSL Sites |accessdate=2008-01-12 |[[date=2008-01-04]] |publisher=HiBlog |author=GuyMac}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the sites, Miyamoto crater (on the southwest corner of Meridiani Planum), was not on the first workshop list and was identified as a desirable landing site on the basis of mineralogical data acquired with CRISM in the time betweenworkshop.  Also, the locations of some of the targets have been refined relative to the first list.

The '''iPhone''' is an [[Internet]]-enabled [[multimedia]] [[smartphone]] designed and marketed by [[Apple Inc.]] It has a [[multi-touch]] screen with [[virtual keyboard]] and [[button (computing)|buttons]], but a minimal amount of hardware input. The iPhone's functions include those of a [[camera phone]] and [[portable media player]] (equivalent to the [[iPod]]) in addition to [[text messaging]] and [[visual voicemail]]. It also offers Internet services including [[e-mail]], [[web browser|web browsing]], and local [[Wi-Fi]] connectivity. The first generation phone hardware was [[quad band|quad-band]] [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] with [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]]; the second generation also adds [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] with [[High-Speed Downlink Packet Access|HSDPA]].&lt;ref name=3G_PR&gt;{{cite press release|title = Apple Introduces the New iPhone 3G|publisher = [[Apple Inc.]]|date = 2008-06-09|url = http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/06/09iphone.html|accessdate = 2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple announced the iPhone on [[9 January]] [[2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/54769/2007/01/iphone.html|title=Apple unveils iPhone|date=2007-01-09|accessdate=2008-04-06|first=Mathew|last=Honan|publisher=[[Macworld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was preceded by [[Apple rumor community|rumors and speculation]] that circulated for several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Dolan|title=Timeline of Apple &quot;iPhone&quot; Rumors (1999-Present)|url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/timeline-apple-iphone-rumors-1999-present|accessdate=2008-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPhone was initially introduced in the [[United States]] on [[29 June]] [[2007]] and is in the process of being introduced worldwide. It was named ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Invention of the Year in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lev|last=Grossman|title=Invention Of the Year: The iPhone|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1678581,00.html|date=2007-10-31|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[11 July]] [[2008]], the '''iPhone 3G''' was released and supported faster [[3G]] data speeds and [[Assisted GPS]].&lt;ref name=3G_PR /&gt;

[[Image:iphone3gsensors.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The proximity and ambient light sensors on the iPhone 3G.]]

=== Screen and interface ===
The 9&amp;nbsp;cm (3.5&amp;nbsp;in) [[liquid crystal display]] (320×480&amp;nbsp;px at 6.3&amp;nbsp;px/mm, 160&amp;nbsp;[[Pixel density|ppi]]) [[HVGA]] [[touchscreen]] with scratch-resistant [[glass]]&lt;ref name=jun18PressRelease&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=2007-06-18|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/06/18iphone.html|title=iPhone Delivers Up to Eight Hours of Talk Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; is specifically created for use with a finger, or multiple fingers for multi-touch sensing. Because the screen is a [[capacitor|capacitive]] touchscreen, bare skin is required; a [[stylus]] or a normal glove prevents the necessary electrical conductivity.&lt;ref name=HowiPhoneWorks&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Tracy|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/iphone.htm|title=How the iPhone Works|publisher=[[How Stuff Works]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pogueFAQ&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=David Pogue|last=Pogue|first=David|url=http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/01/11/the-ultimate-iphone-frequently-asked-questions/|title=The Ultimate iPhone Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=2007-01-11|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pogueFAQ2&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=David Pogue|last=Pogue|first=David|url=http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/01/13/ultimate-iphone-faqs-list-part-2/|title=Ultimate iPhone FAQs list, Part 2|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=2007-01-13|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;;{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/iphone2.htm|title=How the iPhone's touchscreen Works|publisher=[[How Stuff Works]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using [[multi-touch]]. The iPhone [[user interface]] enables the user to move the content itself up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together. Similarly, scrolling through a long list in a menu works as if the list is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel: the wheel can be &quot;spun&quot; by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top (or vice versa). In either case, the list continues to move based on the flicking motion of the finger, slowly decelerating as if affected by [[friction]]. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real 3D object. There are other visual effects, such as horizontally sliding sub-selections and co-selections from right and left, vertically sliding system menus from the bottom (e.g. favorites, keyboard), and menus and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on their back sides.

The display responds to three sensors. A [[distance|proximity]] sensor shuts off the display and [[touchscreen]] when the iPhone is brought near the face to save battery power and to prevent inadvertent inputs from the user's face and ears. An [[low-key lighting|ambient light]] sensor adjusts the display brightness which in turn saves battery power. A 3-axis [[accelerometer]] senses the orientation of the phone and changes the screen accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=R. Collin|url=http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=200900669|title=There's more to MEMS than meets the iPhone|publisher=[[EE Times]]|date=2007-07-09|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photo browsing, web browsing, and music playing support both upright and left or right widescreen orientations, while videos play in only one widescreen orientation.{{Fact|date=June 2008}}

A software update allowed the first generation iPhone to use cell towers and Wi-Fi networks to locate itself despite lacking a hardware [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]. The iPhone 3G includes [[Assisted GPS|A-GPS]] but also uses cell towers and Wi-Fi for location finding.

A single &quot;home&quot; hardware button below the display brings up the main menu. Subselections are made via the touchscreen. The iPhone utilizes a full-paged display, with context-specific submenus at the top and/or bottom of each page, sometimes depending on screen orientation. Detail pages display the equivalent of a &quot;Back&quot; button to return to the parent menu.

The iPhone has three physical switches on its sides: wake/sleep, volume up/down, and ringer on/off. These are made of plastic on the original iPhone and metal on the iPhone 3G. All other multimedia and phone operations are done via the touchscreen. The iPhone 3G features a full plastic back to increase GSM signal strength.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} It also comes in white exclusively for the 16GB model.

===Audio===
The iPhone's headphones are similar to those of most current [[smartphone]]s, incorporating a [[microphone]]. A multipurpose button in the microphone can be used to play or pause music, skip tracks, and answer or end phone calls without touching the iPhone. The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[TRS connector]] for the headphones is located on the top left corner. The headphone socket on the original iPhone is recessed into the casing.  The recess is narrow when compared to many headphone jacks, making them incompatible without the use of an adapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/Apple/?p=828|title=That damned recessed iPhone headphone jack|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The iPhone 3G has a flush mounted headphone socket.

Wireless earpieces that use [[Bluetooth]] technology to communicate with the iPhone are sold separately.  It does not support [[stereophonic sound|stereo audio]].

The loudspeaker is used both for [[handsfree]] operations and media playback, but does not support [[Sound recording and reproduction|voice recording]].

Composite or component video at up to 576i and stereo audio can be output from the dock connector using an adapter sold by Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?spart=MB128LL%2FA|title=Apple Component AV Cable|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|work=[[Apple Store (online)|Apple Online Store]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battery===
The iPhone features a built-in rechargeable battery that is not user-replaceable, similar to existing iPods, but dissimilar to most existing cellular phones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/apple-iphone-8gb-at/4505-6452_7-32309245.html Apple iPhone - 8GB (AT&amp;T) Smartphone reviews - CNET Reviews]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobileburn.com/review.jsp?Id=3526 Apple iPhone Review (MobileBurn)]&lt;/ref&gt; If the battery prematurely reaches the end of its life, the phone can be returned to Apple and replaced for free while still in [[warranty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/service/faq/|title=iPhone Service Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; one year at purchase and extended to two years with [[AppleCare]]. The cost of having Apple provide a new battery and replace it when the iPhone is out of warranty is, in the United States, [[United States dollar|US$]]79 and US$6.95 for shipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/support/iphone/service/battery/|title=iPhone Out-of-Warranty Battery Replacement Program Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since July 2007 third party battery packs have been available&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/07/31/iphones-first-sketchy-battery-replacement-kit-appears/|title=iPhone's first sketchy battery replacement kit appears|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a much lower price than Apple's own battery replacement program. These kits often include a small screwdriver and an instruction leaflet, but as with many newer iPod models the battery in the '''original iPhone''' has been [[solder]]ed in. Therefore a [[soldering iron]] is required to install the new battery. This is not the case with the '''iPhone 3G''' as it uses a different battery fitted with a connector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gizmodo.com/5023983/the-iphone-3g-battery-is-quasi+replaceable iPhone 3G battery is Quasi-replaceable]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original iPhone's battery was stated to be capable of providing up to seven hours of video, six hours of web browsing, eight hours of talk time, 24 hours of music or up to 250 hours on standby.&lt;ref name=jun18PressRelease/&gt; Apple's site says that the battery life &quot;is designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity after 400 full charge and discharge cycles&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/batteries/iphone.html|title=Batteries—iPhone|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is comparable to the iPod batteries.

The iPhone 3G's battery is stated to be capable of providing up to seven hours of video, six hours of web browsing on Wi-Fi or five on 3G, ten hours of 2G talk time, or five on 3G, 24 hours of music, or 300 hours of standby.&lt;ref name=3G_tech_specs /&gt;

The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a [[Consumer protection|consumer advocate]] group, has sent a complaint to Apple and AT&amp;T over the fee that consumers have to pay to have the battery replaced.&lt;ref name=LeeEllen&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Ellen|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/07/11/BUG34QU3921.DTL&amp;type=tech|title=Will a Cheaper iPhone click before Christmas?|publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''|date=2007-07-11|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the battery replacement service and its pricing was not made known to buyers until the day the product was launched,&lt;ref name=LeeEllen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wong|first=May|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/08/AR2007070800562_pf.html|title=Apple Issues Battery Program for IPhone|publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|date=2007-07-08|accessdate=2007-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a similar service had been well established for the iPods by Apple and various third party service providers.

===SIM card===
[[Image:iPhone SIM Slot.jpg|thumb|right|The original iPhone's [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]] slot shown as open, with ejected SIM card.]]
The [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]] is located in a slot at the top of the device, which can be ejected with a paperclip or a SIM card ejection tool which is included with the iPhone 3G.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Diaz|first = Jesus|title = iPhone 3G's New SIM Ejector Tool Makes It Instant Must-Buy|language = English|publisher = Gawker Media|date = 2008-06-09|url = http://gizmodo.com/5014767/iphone-3gs-new-sim-ejector-tool-makes-it-instant-must+buy|accessdate = 2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most countries, the iPhone is usually sold with a [[SIM lock]] preventing the use of SIM cards from different mobile networks.
{{seealso|#SIM Lock removal|l1=iPhone SIM Lock removal}}

===Storage===
The iPhone was initially released with two options for internal storage size; either a 4&amp;nbsp;GB or 8&amp;nbsp;GB flash drive (manufactured by [[Samsung]]) model was available. On [[September 5]], [[2007]], Apple announced they were discontinuing the 4&amp;nbsp;GB models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iphoneatlas.com/2007/09/05/apple-kills-4gb-iphone-cuts-8gb-price-to-399/|title=Apple kills 4 GB iPhone, cuts 8 GB price to $399 - iPhone Atlas|date=2007-09-05|publisher=iPhone Atlas}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[February 5]], [[2008]], Apple announced the addition of a 16&amp;nbsp;GB model to the iPhone lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|http://www.macworld.com/article/131959/2008/02/iphoneipodtouch.html|publisher=[[Macworld]]|title=Apple offers 16GB iPhone, 32GB iPod touch|date=2008-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPhone does not contain any memory card slots for expanded storage.

===Included items and accessories===
Both the iPhone and the iPhone 3G came with a series of included accessories and items when purchased.

====Items common to both versions====

*Appropriate documentation

== Software ==
{{main|iPhone OS}}
[[iPhone OS]] is the [[operating system]] that runs on the iPhone and [[iPod touch]]. It is based on a variant of the same basic [[Mach (kernel)|Mach kernel]] that is found in [[Mac OS X]]. iPhone OS includes the software component &quot;[[Core Animation]]&quot; from [[Mac OS X v10.5]] which, together with the [[PowerVR]] MBX 3D hardware, is responsible for the smooth [[animation]]s used in its user interface. The operating system takes up considerably less than half a [[gigabyte|GB]] of the device's total 8&amp;nbsp;GB or 16&amp;nbsp;GB storage.&lt;ref name=VersatileFlash&gt;{{cite web|last=Haslam|first=Karen|url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipod-itunes/news/index.cfm?newsid=16927|title=Macworld Expo: Optimised OS X sits on 'versatile' flash|publisher=[[Macworld]]|date=2007-01-12|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will be capable of supporting bundled and future applications from Apple.

Like an iPod, the iPhone is managed with [[iTunes version history|iTunes version 7.3 or later]], which is compatible with Mac OS X version 10.4.10 or later, and 32-bit [[Windows XP]] or [[Windows Vista|Vista]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305703|title=iPhone: Minimum system requirements|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of iTunes 7.6 expanded this support to include 64-bit versions of XP and Vista,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Apple's iTunes 7.6 plays nice with 64 bit Vista&quot;|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/01/15/apples-itunes-7-6-plays-nice-with-64-bit-vista/|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=2008-01-15|accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a workaround has been discovered for previous 64-bit Windows operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetamd64.com/index.php?showtopic=35132&amp;st=0&amp;p=327771&amp;#entry327771|title=iTunes is now 64-bit|publisher=PlanetAMD64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPhone's applications cannot simply be copied from Mac OS X and have to be written and compiled specifically for the iPhone. Additionally, the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] [[web browser]] supports [[web application]]s written with [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]].

===Applications===
{{seealso|iPhone OS#iPhone SDK}}
[[Image:iPhone Image Viewer.jpg|thumb|The photo display application]]
There are several applications located on the Home screen: Text (SMS messaging), Calendar, Photos, Camera, YouTube, Stocks, Maps (Google Maps), Weather, Clock, Calculator, Notes, Settings, and iTunes (store). Four other applications, docked at the base of the screen, delineate the iPhone's main purposes: Phone, Mail, Safari, and iPod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|title=iPhone Applications|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=2007-07-11|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The YouTube application streams videos over Wi-Fi, 2G, or 3G after encoding them using the open [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] codec, to which YouTube has converted about 10,000 videos. As a result, the YouTube application on iPhone can currently view only a certain selection of videos from the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/06/20youtube.html|title=YouTube Live on Apple TV Today; Coming to iPhone on June 29|publisher=[[Apple Inc]]|date=2007-06-20|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Worldwide Developers Conference#WWDC 2007|WWDC 2007]] on [[June 11]], [[2007]] Apple announced that the iPhone will support [[third-party developer|third-party]] &quot;applications&quot; via the Safari web browser that share the look and feel of the iPhone interface. On [[October 17]], [[2007]], Steve Jobs, in an open letter posted to Apple's &quot;Hot News&quot; weblog, announced that a [[software development kit]] (SDK) would be made available to third-party developers in February 2008. Due to security concerns and Jobs' praise of Nokia's digital signature system, it was suggested that Apple would adopt a similar method. The SDK will also allow application development for the iPod touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jobs|first=Steve|url=http://developer.apple.com/iphone/devcenter/third_party_apps.php|title=Third Party Applications on the iPhone|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPhone SDK was officially announced on [[March 6]], [[2008]], at the Apple Town Hall facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/03/06/live-from-apples-iphone-press-conference/|title=Live from Apple's iPhone SDK press conference|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SDK will allow developers to develop native applications for the iPhone and iPod touch, as well as test them in an &quot;iPhone simulator&quot;. However, loading an application onto the devices is only possible after paying a [[Apple Developer Connection]] membership fee. Developers are free to set any price for their applications to be distributed through the [[App Store]], of which they will receive a 70 percent share&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michelle |last=Quinn |title=Apple will open App Store in bid to boost iPhone sales |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-iphone10-2008jul10,0,3798678.story |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2008-07-10 |accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Developers can also opt to release the application for free and will not pay any costs to release or distribute the application beyond the membership fee. The SDK was made available immediately, while the launch of applications had to wait until the firmware update which was released on [[July 11]] [[2008]].&lt;ref name=releasedate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/06/09iphone.html|title=Apple Introduces the New iPhone 3G|quote=iPhone 2.0 software will be available on July 11 as a free software update via iTunes® 7.7 or later for all iPhone customers|work=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This update is free for iPhone users and there is a charge for iPod touch owners.

Such native applications could be broken by any software update, but Apple has stated it will not design software updates specifically to break native applications other than applications that perform SIM unlocking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gearlog.com/2007/09/apples_joswiak_we_dont_hate_ip.php|title=Apple's Joswiak: We Don't Hate iPhone Coders|date=2007-09-00|publisher=gearlog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software updates===  
{{main|iPhone OS version history}}
Apple provides free updates to the iPhone's operating system through iTunes, in a similar fashion to the way that iPods are updated.&lt;ref name=VersatileFlash /&gt; Security patches, as well as new and improved features, are released in this fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|laste=Kharif|first=Olga|url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2007/07/coming_soon_iph.html|title=Coming Soon: iPhone Software Updates|publisher=[[BusinessWeek]]|date=2007-07-10|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
The iPhone allows audio [[conference call|conferencing]], call holding, call merging, [[caller ID]], and integration with other cellular network features and iPhone functions. [[voice command device|Voice dialing]] and [[Videophone|video calling]] are not supported by the iPhone.

The iPhone includes a [[visual voicemail]] feature allowing users to view a list of current voicemail messages on-screen without having to call into their voicemail. Unlike most other systems, messages can be listened to and deleted in a non-chronological order by choosing any message from an on-screen list. [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;T]], [[Telefónica Europe|O2]], [[T-Mobile]] Germany, and [[Orange (brand)|Orange]] modified their voicemail infrastructure to accommodate this new feature designed by Apple. A lawsuit has been filed against Apple and AT&amp;T by [[Klausner Technologies Inc.]] claiming the iPhone's visual voicemail feature infringes two patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/071203/20071203005976.html|title=Apple Inc. Sued for Patent Infringement on iPhone by Klausner Technologies, Inc.|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|work=[[Yahoo! News]]|date=2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=June 2008}}

A music [[ringtone]] feature was introduced in the United States on [[September 5]], [[2007]]. For a fee equal to the price of the song on [[iTunes]], the user is allowed to create their custom ringtones. It is not yet available in all countries where the iPhone has been released. The ringtones can be from 3 to 30 seconds in length of any part of a song, can include fading in and out, can pause from half a second to five seconds when looped, and never expire. All customizing can be done in iTunes, and the synced ringtones can also be used for alarms on the iPhone. Custom ringtones can also be created using Apple's [[GarageBand]] software 4.1.1 or later (available only on [[Mac OS X]])&lt;ref name=GarageBand1/&gt; and third-party tools.&lt;ref name=&quot;third party ringtones&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilbertson|first=Scott|title=How to Make Custom IPhone Ringtones Without Paying Apple $2|url=http://www.wired.com/software/coolapps/news/2007/09/ringtone_hacks|work=[[Wired magazine]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]]|date=2007-09-12|accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multimedia ===  
The layout of the music library is similar to [[iPod]]s and current [[Symbian OS|Symbian]] [[S60 platform|S60]] phones, with the sections divided more clearly alphabetically, and with a larger font. Just like iPods, the iPhone can sort its media library by [[song]]s, [[artist]]s, [[album]]s, [[video]]s, [[playlist]]s, [[genre]]s, [[composer]]s, [[podcast]]s, [[audiobook]]s, and [[Compilation album|compilations]]. [[Cover Flow]], like that on [[iTunes]], shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen.

The iPhone supports [[gapless playback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797|title=What is Gapless Playback?|accessdate=2008-05-13|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[iPod classic#Fifth generation|fifth generation iPods]] introduced in 2005, the iPhone can play video, allowing users to watch TV shows and films. Unlike other image-related content, video on the iPhone plays only in the landscape orientation, when the phone is turned sideways. Double tapping switches between wide-screen and full-screen video playback.

The iPhone allows users to purchase and download songs from the [[iTunes Store]] directly to their iPhone over [[Wi-Fi]] with the [[iTunes Store#iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store|iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store]], but not over the cellular data network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/september#thu-27-wifi|title=The Reason It’s Called the Wi-Fi Music Store|date=2007-09-30|accessdate=2008-01-06|first=John|last=Gruber|publisher=[[Daring Fireball]]|authorlink=John Gruber|work=Linked List}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet connectivity ===
[[Image:Wikipedia-English Main Page on iPhone landscape.jpg|thumb|240px|Wikipedia Main Page on iPhone's [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] in landscape mode]]
Internet access is available when the iPhone is connected to a local area [[Wi-Fi]] or a wide area [[GSM]] or [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] network, both second-generation ([[2G]]) wireless data standards. The iPhone 3G supports third-generation [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] and [[High-Speed Downlink Packet Access|HSDPA]], but not [[High-Speed Uplink Packet Access|HSUPA]] networks. [[Steve Jobs]] had stated in September 2007 that [[3G]] would need to become more widespread in the [[United States]] and 3G chipsets would need to become much more energy efficient before inclusion in the iPhone.&lt;ref name=pogueFAQ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/09/18/jobs.uk.cell.carrier.qa/|title=Jobs: battery life issues delaying 3G iPhone|publisher=MacNN|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear whether it supports HSDPA 3.6 or HSDPA 7.2.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} By default, the iPhone will ask to join newly discovered Wi-Fi networks and prompt for the password when required, while also supporting manually joining closed Wi-Fi networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306249|title=iPhone: About Connections Settings|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Wi-Fi is active, the iPhone will automatically switch from the EDGE network to any nearby previously approved Wi-Fi network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305711|title=iPhone: Connecting to the Internet with EDGE or Wi-Fi|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[802.1X]] is supported by the [[iPhone OS]] version 2.0, which is used by many university and corporate Wi-Fi networks.&lt;ref name=&quot;802.1x&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/au/iphone/enterprise/|title=Apple - iPhone - Enterprise|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple Inc]]|accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ubiquitous Internet connection offered by the iPhone has been widely utilized by users. According to [[Google]], the iPhone generates 50 times more search requests than any other mobile handset.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleSearches&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Lane|first=Slash|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/02/14/google_iphone_usage_shocks_search_giant.html|title=Google iPhone usage shocks search giant|publisher=[[AppleInsider]]|date=2008-02-14|accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Deutsche Telekom]] [[chief executive officer|CEO]] [[René Obermann]], &quot;The average Internet usage for an iPhone customer is more than 100&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte|MBytes]]. This is 30 times the use for our average contract-based consumer customers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;iPhoneDataBoom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unstrung.com/document.asp?doc_id=144563&amp;f_src=unstrung_gnews|title=iPhone Data Booms at T-Mobile|publisher=Unstrung|date=2008-01-30|accessdate=2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPhone is able to access the World Wide Web via a modified version of the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] [[web browser]]. Web pages may be viewed in portrait or landscape mode and supports automatic zooming by pinching together or spreading apart fingertips on the screen, or by double-tapping text or images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305899|title=iPhone: Zooming In to See a Page More Easily|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The web browser displays complete web pages similar to a desktop web browser and supports zooming by double-tapping the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solution.allthingsd.com/20070626/the-iphone-is-breakthrough-handheld-computer/|title=The iPhone Is a Breakthrough Handheld Computer|author=Mossberg and Boehret|quote=The iPhone is the first smart phone we’ve tested with a real, computer-grade Web browser, a version of Apple’s Safari. It displays entire Web pages, in their real layouts, and allows you to zoom in quickly by either tapping or pinching with your finger.|date=[[2007-06-26]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPhone does not support [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chartier|first=David|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2007/06/12/its-official-no-flash-support-on-the-iphone-yet/|title=It's official: No Flash support on the iPhone (yet)|publisher=The Unofficial Apple Weblog|date=2007-06-12|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor [[Java (software platform)|Java]] technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericklein.com/2008/03/btw-i-love-apple.html|title=BTW, I love Apple!|date=2008-03-09|accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to AT&amp;T, the iPhone 3G has a maximum download rate of 1.4Mbp/s. (http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-service/specials/iPhone.jsp)

Apple developed an iPhone application for accessing Google's [[Google Maps|maps service]] in map, satellite or hybrid form, a list of search results, or directions between two locations, while providing optional real-time [[traffic]] information. During the product's announcement, Jobs demonstrated this feature by searching for nearby [[Starbucks]] locations and then placing a prank call to one with a single tap.&lt;ref name=keynoteMacworld/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;keynoteEngadget&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Block|first=Ryan|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/live-from-macworld-2007-steve-jobs-keynote/|title=Live from Macworld 2007: Steve Jobs keynote|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=2007-01-09|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Flash isn't supported in Safari on the iPhone, Apple also developed a separate application to view [[YouTube]] videos on the iPhone, similar to the system used for the [[Apple TV]].

=== E-mail ===
The iPhone also features an [[e-mail]] program that supports [[HTML e-mail]], which enables the user to embed photos in an e-mail message. [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[Microsoft Word|Word]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], and [[Microsoft Powerpoint|Powerpoint]] attachments to mail messages can be viewed on the phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/questionsandanswers.html|title=iPhone—Questions and Answers|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's [[MobileMe]] platform offers [[push email]], which emulates the functionality of the popular [[BlackBerry]] email solution, for an annual subscription. [[Yahoo!]] offers a free push-email service for the iPhone. [[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]] (although not [[Push-IMAP]]) and [[Post Office Protocol|POP3]] mail standards are also supported, including [[Microsoft Exchange]]&lt;ref name=Mossberg&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Walter Mossberg|last=Mossberg|first=Walter|coauthor=Boehret, Katherine|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118289311361649057.html|title=Testing Out the iPhone|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|date=2007-06-27|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kerio MailServer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Anthony|last=Frausto-Robledo|url=http://www.architosh.com/news/2007-07/2007a0724_an-kerioiphone.html|title=Analysis: Kerio MailServer delivers email to Apple iPhone|date=2007-07-24|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first versions of the iPhone firmware, this was accomplished by opening up IMAP on the Exchange server. Apple has also licensed [[ActiveSync|Microsoft ActiveSync]] and now supports the platform (including push email) with the release of iPhone 2.0 firmware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2008/03/06/apple-iphone-sdk-event/|title=iPhone to support Exchange|date=2008-03-06|publisher=[[Barron's Magazine|Barron's]]|work=TechTraderDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=releasedate /&gt; The iPhone will sync e-mail account settings over from Apple's own [[Mail (application)|Mail]] application, [[Microsoft Outlook]], and [[Microsoft Entourage]], or manually configured using the device's Settings tool. With the correct settings, the e-mail program can check almost any IMAP or POP3 account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/easysetup/getready.html|title=iPhone—Get Ready|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Camera ===
The iPhone features a built in 2.0&amp;nbsp;[[pixel#megapixel|megapixel]] [[camera]] located on the back for [[photography|still digital photos]]. It has no optical zoom, flash or autofocus, and does not support video recording. 

The iPhone includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and e-mail photos. The user zooms in and out of photos by &quot;unpinching&quot; and &quot;pinching&quot; them through the multi-touch interface. The software interacts with [[iPhoto]] and [[Aperture (photography software)|Aperture]] software on the Mac and [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] software in Windows.  In version 2.0 of the iPhone OS, users can choose to allow location data to be embedded in the pictures producing [[geocoded photograph]]s ([[geotagging]]).

=== Others ===
The built-in [[Bluetooth#Bluetooth 2.0|Bluetooth 2.x+EDR]] supports wireless earpieces, which requires the [[Bluetooth profile#Headset Profile (HSP)|HSP]] [[Bluetooth profile|profile]], but notably does not support [[stereophonic sound|stereo audio]] (requires [[Bluetooth profile#Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP)|A2DP]]), laptop [[tethering]] (requires [[Bluetooth profile#Dial-up Networking Profile (DUN)|DUN]] and [[Bluetooth profile#Serial Port Profile (SPP)|SPP]]), or the [[OBEX]] [[Bluetooth protocols#OBEX|file transfer]] [[Bluetooth protocols|protocol]] (requires [[Bluetooth profile#File Transfer Profile (FTP)|FTP]], [[Bluetooth profile#Generic Object Exchange Profile (GOEP)|GOEP]], and [[Bluetooth profile#Object Push Profile (OPP)|OPP]]). The lack of these profiles prevent iPhone users from exchanging multimedia files with other bluetooth-enabled cell phones, including pictures, music and videos.

Text messages are presented chronologically in a mailbox format similar to [[Mail (application)|Mail]], which places all text from recipients together with replies. Text messages are displayed in speech bubbles (similar to [[iChat]]) under each recipient's name. The iPhone currently has built-in support for e-mail message forwarding, drafts, and direct internal camera-to-e-mail picture sending. However, it does not yet have capabilities for delivery reports, [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]], or [[cut, copy, and paste|copy/cut/paste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ricker|first=Thomas|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/27/iphones-missing-ichat-mms-etc-coming-via-software-updates/|title=iPhone's missing iChat, MMS, etc. coming via software updates?|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=2007-06-27|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for multi-recipient [[SMS]] was added in the January 2008 (v1.1.3) software update.

=== Text input ===
[[Image:IPhone keyboard unblured.jpg|thumb|[[Virtual keyboard]] on the original iPhone's [[touchscreen]].]]
For text input, the device implements a [[virtual keyboard]] on the touchscreen. It has automatic [[spell checker|spell checking]] and correction, [[Predictive text|predictive word]] capabilities, and a dynamic dictionary that learns new words. The predictive word capabilities have been integrated with the dynamic virtual keyboard so that users will not have to be extremely accurate when typing—i.e. touching the edges of the desired letter or nearby letters on the keyboard will be predictively corrected when possible. The keys are somewhat larger and spaced farther apart when in [[landscape mode]], currently available using the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser and certain third-party applications with Landscape Mode support. Not focusing more on texting has been considered a chief weakness of the iPhone, while at the same time others believe the virtual keyboard to be a bold step and a worthwhile risk.&lt;ref name=hasAKeyboard&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=John Markoff|last=Markoff|first=John|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/technology/13phone.ready.html|title=That iPhone Has a Keyboard, but It’s Not Mechanical|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=2007-06-13|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of a physical keyboard allows for the keyboard to be optimized for different applications and languages.

===Accessibility===
According to Apple's [[accessibility]] statement &quot;effective use of the iPhone 3G requires a minimal level of visual acuity, motor skills, and an ability to operate a few mechanical buttons. Use of iPhone 3G by someone who relies solely on audible and tactile input is not recommended.&quot; The iPhone 3G can by used with external [[Telecommunications device for the deaf|TDD/TTY]] devices using a separately purchased adaptor cable. The iPhone 3G has not been rated  under the United States Federal 
Communication Commission guidelines for hearing aid compatibility at either level M3 or T3.

Apple has filed more than 300 [[patent]]s related to the technology behind the iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ishimaru|first=Heather|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/business&amp;id=4920783|title=Apple Options Not An Issue At Macworld|publisher=[[ABC 7|abc7news.com]]|date=2007-01-09|accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/index.html#technology|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|title=iPhone - Features - High Technology|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LG Electronics]] claimed the iPhone's design was copied from the [[LG Prada (KE850)|LG Prada]]. Woo-Young Kwak, head of LG Mobile Handset R&amp;D Center, said at a press conference, “We consider that Apple copied Prada phone after the design was unveiled when it was presented in the iF Design Award and won the prize in September 2006.”&lt;ref name=am&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.applematters.com/article/the-iphone-lawsuits/|title=The iPhone Lawsuits|publisher=Apple Matters|first=Aaron|last=Wright|date=2007-02-20|accessdate=2007-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, Apple applied for the &quot;iPhone&quot; trademark in the United Kingdom, [[Australia]], [[Singapore]], and the [[European Union]]. A [[Canadian]] application followed in October 2004 and a [[New Zealand]] application in September 2006. As of October 2006 only the Singapore and Australian applications had been granted. In September 2006, a company called Ocean Telecom Services applied for an &quot;iPhone&quot; trademark in the United States, United Kingdom and [[Hong Kong]], following a filing in [[Trinidad and Tobago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-find/t-find-number?detailsrequested=C&amp;trademark=E5341301|title=Case details for Community Trade Mark E5341301|publisher=[[UK Intellectual Property Office]]|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ocean Telecom trademark applications use exactly the same wording as Apple's New Zealand application, it is assumed that Ocean Telecom is applying on behalf of Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://10layers.com/2006/10/apple-filing-for-iphone-trademarks-worldwide/|title=Apple filing for iPhone trademarks worldwide|publisher=10layers.com|date=2006-10-17|accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian application was opposed in August 2005 by a Canadian company called [[Comwave]] who themselves applied for the trademark three months later. Comwave have been selling VoIP devices called iPhone since 2004.&lt;ref name=CiscoFacesiPhone/&gt;

Shortly after Steve Jobs' [[January 9]], [[2007]] announcement that Apple would be selling a product called iPhone in June 2007, Cisco issued a statement that it had been negotiating trademark licensing with Apple and expected Apple to agree to the final documents that had been submitted the night before.&lt;ref name=AppleHelloiPhone&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Owen Thomas (journalist)|last=Thomas|first=Owen|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/01/09/technology/apple_jobs/index.htm|title=Apple: Hello, iPhone|publisher=[[CNN|CNN Money]]|date=2007-01-09|accessdate=2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[January 10]], [[2007]] Cisco announced it had filed a lawsuit against Apple over the infringement of the trademark iPhone, seeking an injunction in federal court to prohibit Apple from using the name.&lt;ref name=CiscoTrademark&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2007/corp_011007.html|title=Cisco Sues Apple for Trademark Infringement|publisher=[[Cisco Systems]]|date=2007-01-10|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Cisco claimed that the trademark lawsuit was a &quot;minor skirmish&quot; that was not about money, but about interoperability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1047_3-6153339.html|title=Report: Cisco CEO calls iPhone suit 'minor skirmish'|publisher=[[News.com]]|author=[[Reuters]]|date=2007-01-25|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[February 2]], [[2007]], Apple and Cisco announced that they had agreed to temporarily suspend litigation while they hold settlement talks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003552200_iphone02.html|title=Cisco, Apple decide to talk over iPhone|first=May|last=Wong|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=2007-02-02|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently announced on [[February 20]], [[2007]] that they had reached an agreement.

==Restrictions==
===SIM Lock removal===
While initially iPhones were only sold on the AT&amp;T network with a [[SIM lock]] in place, various [[Hacker (computing)|hackers]] have found methods to &quot;unlock&quot; the phone; more recently some carriers have started to sell unlocked iPhones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pcretailmag.com/news/29052/Orange-to-sell-iPhone-SIM-free-for-749|title=Orange to sell iPhone SIM-free for €749|date=2007-11-29|accessdate=2008-01-06|publisher=PC Retail Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;. More than a quarter of iPhones sold in the United States were not registered with AT&amp;T. Apple speculates that they were likely shipped overseas and unlocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7214873.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2008-01-28|title=Quarter of US iPhones 'unlocked'}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AT&amp;T has stated that the &quot;iPhone cannot be unlocked, even if you are out of contract&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wireless.att.com/answer-center/main.jsp?t=solutionTab&amp;ft=searchTab&amp;ps=solutionPanels&amp;locale=en_US&amp;_dyncharset=UTF-8&amp;solutionId=61097&amp;isSrch=Yes AT&amp;T Mobility Answer Center: ''What is the unlock code for my iPhone?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IPhone unlock v2.jpg|thumb|Unlocked iPhone firmware version 2.0 using [[GrameenPhone]] Network in [[Bangladesh]]]]

On [[November 21]], [[2007]], [[T-Mobile]] in [[Germany]] announced it would sell the phone unlocked and without a T-Mobile contract, caused by a preliminary injunction against T-Mobile put in place by their competitor, [[Vodafone]]. In Germany, a company is not allowed to lock the SIM card to itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSWEB918820071121|title=T-mobile to sell Iphone without contract|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=2007-11-21|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[December 4]], [[2007]], a German court decided to grant T-Mobile exclusive rights to sell the iPhone with SIM lock, overturning the temporary injunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/T-Mobile-Germany-stops-selling-unlocked-iPhones/2100-1039_3-6221306.html?tag=nefd.top|title=T-Mobile Germany stops selling unlocked iPhones|publisher=[[CNET]]|date=2007-12-04|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, T-Mobile will voluntarily offer to unlock customers' iPhone after the termination of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.betanews.com/article/Hamburg_court_relocks_iPhone_in_Germany/1196796105|title=Hamburg court re-locks iPhone in Germany|date=2007-12-04|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On carriers where removal of the iPhone's SIM lock is allowed the carrier can submit a request to Apple which will then remove the carrier locking on the next restore of the iPhone through iTunes. Customers of the carriers [[Optus]] and [[Vodafone]] in Australia have so far been successful in unlocking their phones to work on any network.

===Activation===

The iPhone normally prevents access to its media player and web features unless it has also been activated as a phone with an authorized carrier. On [[July 3]], [[2007]], [[Jon Lech Johansen]] reported on his blog that he had successfully bypassed this requirement and unlocked the iPhone's other features with a combination of custom software and modification of the iTunes binary. He published the software and offsets for others to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nanocr.eu/2007/07/03/iphone-without-att/|title=iPhone Independence Day|publisher=nanocr.eu|first=Jon Lech|last=Johansen|authorlink=Jon Lech Johansen|date=2007-07-03|accessdate=2008-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the original, the 3G iPhone must be activated in the store in most countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.maclife.com/article/iphone_3g_in_store_activation_only|title=iPhone 3G - In-Store Activation Only|publisher=Mac|Life|first=Roberto|last=Baldwin|date=2008-06-09|accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This need for in-store activation, as well as the huge number of first-generation iPhone and [[iPod Touch]] users upgrading to iPhone OS 2.0, caused a worldwide [[overload]] of Apple's [[Server (computing)|servers]] on [[July 11]] [[2008]], the day on which both the iPhone 3G and iPhone OS 2.0 updates were released. After the update, devices were required to connect to Apple's servers to authenticate the update, causing many devices to be temporarily unusable. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/12/business/12iphone.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology&amp;oref=slogin|title=iPhone Users Plagued by Software Problems.|publisher=New York Times|first=John|last=Markoff|date=2008-07-012|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on the [[Telefónica Europe|O2]] network in the [[United Kingdom]], users  can buy the phone online and activate it via [[iTunes]], as with the previous model. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.o2.co.uk/iphone/paymonthly Pay Monthly - iPhone - O2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in Australia, iPhones purchased as a pre-paid kit do not require in-store activation, but require activation online at the Optus website and iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;Optus iPhone Pre-Paid - Start Up Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third party applications===
The iPhone's operating system is designed to only run software that has an Apple-approved [[Code signing|cryptographic signature]]. This restriction can be overcome by &quot;jailbreaking&quot; the phone&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-9806428-37.html iPhone jailbreak for the masses]&lt;/ref&gt;, which involves replacing the iPhone's firmware with a slightly modified version that does not enforce the signature check. Doing so may be a circumvention of Apple's [[technical protection measures]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/politics/onlinerights/commentary/circuitcourt/2007/08/circuitcourt_0829 Legal or Not, IPhone Hacks Might Spur Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt;, which in the United States would be legal under special provisions of the [[DMCA|Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] that allows for circumvention for the purpose of connecting a wireless telephone to a wireless telephone communication network&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2006/71fr68472.pdf Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems for Access Control Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <comment>smog is a likely contributor to global dimming, not the golden gate bridge.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Pollution}}
'''Global dimming''' is the gradual reduction in the amount of global direct [[irradiance]] at the [[Earth]]'s surface that was observed for several decades after the start of systematic measurements in 1950s. The effect varies by location, but worldwide it has been estimated to be of the order of a 4% reduction over the three decades from 1960–1990. However, since 1990, the trend has reversed.&lt;ref name=AR4_9_2_2_2/&gt;

It is thought to have been caused by an increase in [[particulates]] such as sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere due to human action. The switch from a &quot;global dimming&quot; trend to a &quot;brightening&quot; trend in 1990 happened just as global aerosol levels started to decline.

Global dimming has interfered with the [[hydrological cycle]] by reducing evaporation and may have reduced rainfall in some areas. Global dimming also creates a [[global cooling|cooling]] effect that may have partially masked the effect of [[greenhouse gas]]es on [[global warming]].

==Causes and effects==
{{See|Albedo|irradiance|insolation}}

It is thought that global dimming was probably due to the increased presence of [[Particulate|aerosol]] particles in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] caused by human action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aerosols and other particulates absorb solar energy and reflect sunlight back into space. The pollutants can also become [[Cloud condensation nuclei|nuclei]] for cloud droplets. Water droplets in [[cloud]]s [[Coalescence|coalesce]] around the particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=2008-04-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased pollution causes more particulates and thereby creates clouds consisting of a greater number of smaller droplets (that is, the same amount of water is spread over more droplets). The smaller droplets make clouds more [[albedo|reflective]], so that more incoming sunlight is reflected back into space and less reaches the earth's surface.

Clouds intercept both heat from the sun and heat radiated from the Earth. Their effects are complex and vary in time, location, and altitude. Usually during the daytime the interception of sunlight predominates, giving a cooling effect; however, at night the re-radiation of heat to the Earth slows the Earth's heat loss.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the ice-albedo feedback created a positive feedback loop in the Earth's climate system. The more snow and ice, the more solar radiation is reflected back into space and hence the colder Earth grows and the more it snows. Other studies found that pollution or a volcano eruption could snap Earth into an ice age.&lt;ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s, [[Atsumu Ohmura]], a geography researcher at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]], found that solar radiation striking the Earth's surface had declined by more than 10% over the three previous decades. His findings are in apparent contradiction to [[global warming]]—the global temperature has steadily been going up. Less light reaching the earth would mean that it would have to cool. Ohmura published his findings &quot;Secular variation of global radiation in Europe&quot; in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohmura and Lang 1989&quot;&gt;

It is difficult to make a precise measurement, due to the difficulty in accurately [[Calibration|calibrating]] the instruments used, and the problem of spatial coverage. Nonetheless, the effect is almost certainly present.

The effect (2–3%, as above) is due to changes within the Earth's atmosphere; the value of the solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere has not changed by more than a fraction of this amount.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eddy et al 1982&quot;&gt;

Note that these numbers are for the terrestrial surface and not really a global average. Whether dimming (or brightening) occurred over the ocean has been a bit of an unknown though a specific measurement (see below, Causes) measured effects some 400 miles (643.7 km) from India over the Indian Ocean towards the Maldives Islands. Regional effects probably dominate but are not strictly confined to the land area, and the effects will be driven by regional air circulation.

The largest reductions are found in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] mid-latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;

==Pan evaporation data==
{{See|Pan evaporation}}
Over the last 50 or so years, [[pan evaporation]] has been carefully monitored. For decades, nobody took much notice of the pan evaporation measurements. But in the 1990s in Europe, Israel, and North America, scientists spotted something that at the time was considered very strange, the rate of evaporation was falling although they had expected it to increase due to [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roderick and Farquhar 2002&quot;&gt;

However, unlike in other areas of the world, in China the decrease in solar irradiance was not always accompanied by an increase in cloud cover and precipitation. It is believed that [[Particulate|aerosols]] may play a critical role in the decrease of solar irradiance in China.&lt;ref name =&quot;Liu et al 2004&quot;&gt;

The incomplete combustion of fossil fuels (such as [[diesel]]) and wood releases [[black carbon]] into the air. Though black carbon, most of which is [[soot]], is an extremely small component of air pollution at land surface levels, the phenomenon has a significant heating effect on the atmosphere at altitudes above two kilometers (6,562 ft). Also, it dims the surface of the ocean by absorbing solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Experiments in the [[Maldives]] (comparing the atmosphere over the northern and southern islands) in the 1990s showed that the effect of macroscopic pollutants in the atmosphere at that time (blown south from [[India]]) caused about a 10% reduction in sunlight reaching the surface in the area under the [[pollution]] cloud &amp;mdash; a much greater reduction than expected from the presence of the particles themselves.&lt;ref&gt;

Prior to the research being undertaken, predictions were of a 0.5–1% effect from [[particulate]] matter; the variation from prediction may be explained by cloud formation with the particles acting as the focus for droplet creation.  
Clouds are very effective at [[Reflection (physics)|reflecting]] light back out into space.

The phenomenon underlying global dimming may also have regional effects. While most of the earth has warmed, the regions that are downwind from major sources of air pollution (specifically sulfur dioxide emissions) have generally cooled. This may explain the cooling of the eastern United States relative to the warming western part.&lt;ref&gt;

However some research shows that black carbon will actually increase global warming being second only to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. They believe that soot will absorb solar energy and transport it to other areas such as the Himalayas where glacial melt occurs. It can also darken Arctic ice reducing reflectivity and increasing absorption of solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;

Some climate scientists have theorized that aircraft [[contrail]]s (also called ''vapor trails'') are implicated in global dimming, but the constant flow of air traffic previously meant that this could not be tested. The near-total shutdown of [[Civil aviation|civil air traffic]] during the three days following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] afforded a rare opportunity in which to observe the climate of the [[United States]] absent from the effect of contrails. During this period, an increase in [[Day|diurnal]] temperature variation of over 1 [[°C]] (1.8 [[°F]]) was observed in some parts of the U.S., i.e. aircraft contrails may have been raising nighttime temperatures and/or lowering daytime temperatures by much more than previously thought.&lt;ref name=contrails /&gt;

Airborne [[volcanic ash]] can reflect the Sun's rays back out into space and cool the planet. Dips in earth temperatures have been observed from large volcano eruptions such as [[Mount Agung]] in Bali that erupted in 1963, El Chichon (Mexico) 1983, [[Nevado del Ruiz|Ruiz]] (Colombia) 1985, and [[Mount Pinatubo|Pinatubo]] (Philippines) 1991. But even for major eruptions, the ash clouds remain only for relatively short periods.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;

A 2007 [[NASA]] sponsored satellite-based study sheds light on the puzzling observations by other scientists that the amount of sunlight reaching Earth's surface had been steadily declining in recent decades, suddenly started to rebound around 1990. This switch from a &quot;global dimming&quot; trend to a &quot;brightening&quot; trend happened just as global aerosol levels started to decline.&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerr 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

It is likely that at least some of this change, particularly over Europe, is due to decreases in pollution. Most governments of [[developed nation]]s have done more to reduce aerosols released into the atmosphere, which helps reduce global dimming, than to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.

Sulfate aerosols have declined significantly since 1970 with the [[Clean Air Act]] in the United States and similar policies in Europe. The Clean Air Act was strengthened in 1977 and 1990. According to the EPA, from 1970 to 2005, total emissions of the six principal air pollutants, including PM’s, dropped by 53% in the US. In 1975, the masked effects of trapped greenhouse gases finally started to emerge and have dominated ever since.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Baseline Surface Radiation Network]] (BSRN) has been collecting surface measurements. BSRN was started in the early 1990s and updated the archives in this time. Analysis of recent data reveals that the surface of the planet has brightened by about 4% in the past decade. The brightening trend is corroborated by other data, including satellite analyses.

==Relationship to hydrological cycle==
[[Image:Climate Change Attribution.png|thumb|right|230px|This figure shows the level of agreement between a [[climate model]] driven by five factors and the [[historical temperature record]]. The negative component identified as &quot;sulfate&quot; is associated with the aerosol emissions blamed for global dimming.]]
{{See|Hydrological cycle}}
Pollution produced by humans may be seriously weakening the Earth's [[water cycle]] &amp;mdash; reducing rainfall and threatening fresh water supplies. A 2001 study by researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography suggests that tiny particles of soot and other pollutants have a significant effect on the hydrological cycle. According to Professor V. Ramanathan: &quot;The energy for the hydrological cycle comes from sunlight. As sunlight heats the ocean, water escapes into the atmosphere and falls out as rain. So as aerosols cut down sunlight by large amounts, they may be spinning down the hydrological cycle of the planet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

Large scale changes in weather patterns may also have been caused by global dimming. [[Climate model]]s speculatively suggest that this reduction in sunshine at the surface may have led to the failure of the [[monsoon]] in sub-[[Sahara]]n [[Africa]] during the 1970s and 1980s, together with the associated [[famine]]s such as the [[Sahel drought]], caused by Northern hemisphere pollution cooling the [[Atlantic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rotstayn and Lohmann 2002&quot;&gt;

Because of this, the [[Tropical rain belt]] may not have risen to its northern latitudes, thus causing an absence of seasonal rains. This claim is not universally accepted and is very difficult to test.

It is also concluded that the imbalance between global dimming and global warming at the surface leads to weaker turbulent heat fluxes to the atmosphere. This means globally reduced evaporation and hence precipitation occur in a dimmer and warmer world, which could ultimately lead to a more humid atmosphere in which it rains less.&lt;ref&gt;

A natural form of large scale environmental shading/dimming has been identified that affected the 2006 northern hemisphere [[hurricane season]]. The [[NASA]] study found that several major dust storms in June and July in the [[Sahara]] desert sent dust drifting over the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and through several effects caused cooling of the waters &amp;mdash; and thus dampening the development of hurricanes.&lt;ref&gt;

==Relationship to global warming==
{{See|Global warming}}

Some scientists now consider that the effects of global dimming have masked the effect of [[global warming]] to some extent and that resolving global dimming may therefore lead to increases in predictions of future temperature rise.&lt;ref name=gbd2 /&gt; According to Beate Liepert, &quot;We lived in a global warming plus a global dimming world and now we are taking out global dimming. So we end up with the global warming world, which will be much worse than we thought it will be, much hotter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

But it's much more complicated than an either warming or dimming issue. Global warming and global dimming are not mutually exclusive or contradictory. In a paper published on [[March 8]], [[2005]] in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters, a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, New York, also showed that the apparently opposing forces of global warming and global dimming can occur at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;

Water vapor is one of the greenhouse gases. On the other hand, global dimming is affected by evaporation and rain. Rain has the effect of clearing out polluted skies.

Brown clouds have been found to amplify global warming according to V. Ramanathan, an atmospheric chemist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, CA.  &quot;The conventional thinking is that brown clouds have masked as much as 50 percent of global warming by greenhouse gases through so-called global dimming,&quot; ... &quot;While this is true globally, this study reveals that over southern and eastern Asia, the soot particles in the brown clouds are in fact amplifying the atmospheric warming trend caused by greenhouse gases by as much as 50 percent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Possible use to mitigate global warming==
{{See|Mitigation of global warming|Albedo}}

Some scientists have suggested using aerosols to stave off the effects of global warming as an emergency measure. Russian expert [[Mikhail Budyko]] understood this relationship very early on. In 1974, he suggested that if global warming became a problem, the planet could be cooled by burning sulfur in the stratosphere, which would create a haze.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Carmelo Kiyan Anthony''' (born [[May 29]][[1984]]) is an [[United States|American]] professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Denver Nuggets]], of the [[National Basketball Association]]. As a freshman in college, Anthony led [[Syracuse University]] to a 30–5 record and the school's first [[NCAA]] championship in [[College basketball|men's basketball]]. He was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the 2003 [[NCAA Final Four]] and MVP of NCAA East Regional. He was also named the consensus national Freshman of the Year and was a unanimous choice as the [[Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East Conference]] Freshman of the Year. Anthony was selected as the third pick in the [[2003 NBA Draft]], and named the 2005 Rookie Challenge MVP. 

==Early years==

Anthony was born in the [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook projects]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=redhook&gt;

Kenny Minor, one of Anthony's childhood friends, said, &quot;from drugs, to killings, to anything you can name that goes on in the roughest parts of town, we've seen and witnessed hands on.  Those are the things that teach you toughness and keep you mentally focused on your goals.&quot;  Sports would serve as an important diversion from the violence and drug dealing that were pervasive in the housing projects a few blocks from the homes of Anthony and his friends.&lt;ref name=eightyears&gt;

While at Oak Hill Academy, Anthony was named to the [[McDonald's All-American Team]] and won the ''[[Sprite (soft drink)|Sprite]] Slam Jam'' dunk contest prior to the McDonald’s All-American game.  He was also named a [[USA Today]] First-Team All-American and a [[Parade (magazine)|Parade]] First-Team All-American.&lt;ref name=nbadotcomdraftbio&gt; {{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/draft2003/profiles/AnthonyCarmelo.html | title=Prospect Profile: Carmelo Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony  played one season (2002-2003) at [[Syracuse University]].  He averaged 22.1 points (16th in the [[NCAA]], 4th in the [[Big East]]) and 10.0 rebounds (19th in the NCAA, 3rd in the Big East, 1st among NCAA Division I freshmen). He helped guide the Orangemen to their first ever [[NCAA tournament]] title in 2003.  He led the team in scoring, rebounding, minutes played (36.4 minutes per game), field goals made and free throws made and attempted.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/anthoca01.html | title=Carmelo Anthony Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anthony's 33-point outburst against the [[University of Texas]] in the [[2003 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Final Four]] set an NCAA tournament record for most points by a freshman.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/2003/ncaa_tourney/news/2003/04/05/syracuse_texas_ap/  | title=Super-frosh scores 33; 'Cuse beats Texas in Final Four}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the championship game against the [[University of Kansas]], Anthony had 20 points and 10 rebounds.  For his efforts during the NCAA tournament, Anthony earned the tournament's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player Award]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE7DF1138F93BA35757C0A9659C8B63 | title=Freshmen Give Boeheim a Finish to Savor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Syracuse head coach [[Jim Boeheim]] described Anthony as, &quot;....by far, the best player in [[college basketball]].  It wasn't even close.  Nobody was even close to him last year in college basketball. That's the bottom line.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web| url=http://www.suathletics.com/Sports/basketball/mbasket/2003/boeheimmediadayquotes.asp | title=Coach Boeheim Quotes - Media Day 2003-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthony said that he originally planned to stay at Syracuse for two to three seasons, but having already accomplished everything he set out to do, he chose to abandon his collegiate career (with Boeheim's blessing) and declared himself eligible for the [[2003 NBA Draft]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=3038092 | title=New Building will bear NBA star Anthony's name}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E1D8173DF936A15757C0A9659C8B63&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/A/Anthony,%20Carmelo | title=Anthony Says He'll Turn Pro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Anthony's highlights in his time with Syracuse include being named Second-Team All-American by the [[Associated Press]] as a freshman, leading his team to a 30-5 record, capturing the school's first ever NCAA title and being the consensus pick for NCAA Freshman of the Year.  He was also named to the All-Big East First Team and was the consensus selection for the Big East Conference Freshman of the Year.&lt;ref name=usabasketballbio&gt;

==NBA career==
===Rookie season===

Anthony's NBA career began on [[June 26]], [[2003]], when he was chosen in the first round (3rd overall) of the [[2003 NBA Draft]] draft by the [[Denver Nuggets]].  He was selected behind [[LeBron James]] (1st overall, [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]) and [[Darko Miličić]] (2nd overall, [[Detroit Pistons]]).&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press ([[June 26]], [[2003]]). &quot;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/2003/draft/news/2003/06/26/nuggets_anthony_ap/ Denver ecstatic to get Anthony with third pick]&quot;. CNN/SI. Retrieved on [[2008-07-08]].&lt;/ref&gt; He made his NBA regular season debut on [[October 29]], [[2003]], in an 80-72 home win against the [[San Antonio Spurs]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press ([[October 29]], [[2003]]). &quot;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=231029007 San Antonio vs. Denver Recap]&quot;. ESPN. Retrieved on [[2008-07-08]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Anthony finished the night with 12 points, 7 rebounds and 3 assists. In just his sixth career NBA game ([[November 7]] versus the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]), Anthony scored 30 points, becoming the second youngest player in NBA history to score 30 points or more in a game (19 years, 151 days; [[Kobe Bryant]] was the youngest).&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press.

Retrieved on [[2008-07-08]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was the fewest amount of games a Nuggets rookie took to score 30 points in a contest since the ABA/NBA merger. On [[February 9]], [[2004]], against the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], Anthony became the third-youngest player to reach the 1,000-point plateau in NBA history with a 20-point effort in an 86-83 win.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press ([[February 9]], [[2004]]). &quot;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=240209007 Memphis vs. Denver Recap]&quot;. ESPN. Retrieved on [[2008-07-08]].&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[2003-04 NBA season]]). 

On [[February 13]], [[2004]], Anthony participated in the [[Got Milk?]] [[Rookie Challenge]] at [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Weekend]].&lt;ref name=NBAbio/&gt; In 30 minutes of playing time, Anthony scored 17 points, grabbed 3 rebounds and dished out 5 assists in a losing effort (142-118).&lt;ref&gt;Ticker ([[February 13]], [[2004]]). &quot;[http://www.nba.com/games/20040213/RKESPH/recap.html Stoudemire Showcases Skills for Sophs]&quot;.

Retrieved on [[2008-07-08]].&lt;/ref&gt; On [[March 30]] of that year, he scored 41 points against the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] to set a new Denver Nuggets franchise mark for most points in a game by a rookie.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press ([[March 30]], [[2004]]). &quot;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=240330007 Seattle vs. Denver Recap]&quot;. ESPN. Retrieved on [[2008-07-08]].&lt;/ref&gt;  He also became the second-youngest player (19 years, 305 days) to score at least 40 points in a game in NBA history. After winning the Rookie of the Month award for the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] in the month of April, Anthony became the fourth player in NBA history to capture all six of the Rookie of the Month awards in a season.&lt;ref name=nbadotcomdraftbio /&gt;  The others to do so were [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]], [[Tim Duncan]] and fellow rookie [[LeBron James]].&lt;ref name=usabasketballbio /&gt; Anthony was also named NBA Player of the Week twice ([[March 10]], [[2004]] &amp;ndash; [[March 14]], [[2004]] and [[April 6]], [[2004]] &amp;ndash; [[April 10]], [[2004]]) and was a unanimous NBA All-Rookie First Team selection.  Anthony averaged 21.0 ppg during the season, which was more than any other rookie.  That mark also placed him 12th overall in the entire league.  Anthony was second in the [[NBA Rookie of the Year]] voting, finishing as the runner-up to the Cavaliers rookie standout, James.

Anthony was a major part in the turn around of the Denver Nuggets from league laughingstock to playoff contender. In the season before Anthony was drafted by the team, the Nuggets finished with a 17-65 record, which tied them for worst in the NBA with the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. They finished the [[2003-04 NBA season|2003-04]] campaign with a 43-39 overall record, qualifying them as the eighth seed for the [[NBA playoffs|post-season]].  Anthony became the first NBA rookie to lead a playoff team in scoring since [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] of the [[San Antonio Spurs]] during the [[1989-90 NBA season|1989-90 season]].&lt;ref name=nbadotcomdraftbio /&gt;  The Nuggets faced the top-seeded [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in the first round.  In Anthony's first career playoff game, he had 19 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists, in a 106-92 loss at Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press.

===2004–05 season===

In Anthony's second season, he started in 75 of the 82 games for the Denver Nuggets.  He averaged 20.8 points per game, ranking him 19th in the NBA.  Anthony placed 16th in the NBA for points per 48 minutes.  On [[December 4]], [[2004-05 NBA season|2004]], versus the [[Miami Heat]], Anthony became the third-youngest player in NBA history to reach 2,000 career points.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press ([[December 04]], [[2004]]). &quot;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=241204007 ESPN - Miami vs. Denver Recap]&quot;. Retrieved on [[2008-07-08]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Only James and Bryant were younger when they reached that plateau.  Anthony played again in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge, this time suiting up for the sophomore squad. In front of his home fans of Denver (who were hosting the [[2005 NBA All-Star Game|2005 All-Star Game]]), Anthony scored a game-high 31 points to go along with 5 boards, 2 assists and 2 steals, en route to becoming the MVP of the game.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press ([[February 19]], [[2005]]). &quot;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/allstar2005/news/story?id=1994829 Anthony gains MVP honors]&quot;.

With Anthony's help, the Nuggets improved their season record by six games from the previous season, ending with a mark of 49-33.  The Nuggets finished seventh place in the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] (one spot higher than they finished the previous season).  Denver faced the second-seeded San Antonio Spurs in the first round, winning the first game in San Antonio, 93-87.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press ([[April 24]], [[2005]]). &quot;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=250424024 Denver vs. San Antonio Recap]&quot;.

===2005–06 season===

Anthony played and started in 80 games during the season.  He averaged 26.5 ppg (8th, NBA), 2.7 apg, 4.9 rpg and 1.1 spg.  His eighth place finish in NBA scoring was the highest finish by a Denver player since the [[1990-91 NBA season|1990-91]] season, when Nuggets guard [[Michael Adams (basketball)|Michael Adams]] finished the season sixth in NBA scoring.

On [[November 23]], [[2005]], with the Nuggets facing the two-time defending [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] Champion Detroit Pistons, Anthony hauled down his 1,000th career rebound. A month later, Anthony recorded a then career-high 45 points in a losing effort against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]. On [[March 17]], [[2006]], versus the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], he scored 33 points to push his career point total over the 5,000 mark.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press ([[March 17]], [[2006]]). &quot;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=260317029 Denver vs. Memphis Recap]&quot;.

As the month of March came to a close, the Nuggets finished 11-5, and Anthony was named as the NBA Player of the Month for March.  He also took home Player of the Week honors for [[March 13]], [[2006]] &amp;ndash; [[March 19]], [[2006]].&lt;ref&gt;([[March 20]], [[2006]]). &quot;[http://www.nba.com/nuggets/news/anthony_pow_032006.html Anthony Named Western Conference Player of the Week]&quot;.

'''Elisha Nelson &quot;Eli&quot; Manning IV''' (born [[January 3]], [[1981]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]) is an [[American football]] [[quarterback]] for the [[New York Giants]] of the [[National Football League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/EManning/Eli_bio.html|title=Eli Manning bio|author=|publisher=www.jockbio.com|accessdate= 2007-11-01|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the younger brother of [[Peyton Manning]] and [[Cooper Manning]] and the son of [[Archie Manning]] and Olivia Manning.&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot;/&gt; He played [[college football]] at the [[University of Mississippi]] after prepping at the prestigious [[Isidore Newman School]] in New Orleans.&lt;ref name=&quot;nflplayers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nflplayers.com/players/player.aspx?id=35635&amp;section=bio|title=Eli Manning-PLAYERS-NFLPLAYERS.COM|author=|publisher=NFL Players Association|accessdate=2008-03-05|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manning was the MVP of [[Super Bowl XLII]] on [[February 3]], [[2008]], in which he led the Giants to an upset victory over the [[New England Patriots]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sup42&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/recap?game_id=29526&amp;displayPage=tab_recap&amp;season=2007&amp;week=POST21|title=Patriots nearly perfect, but the Giants are Super Bowl champions|author=Associated Press|publisher=NFL.com|accessdate=2008-03-08|date=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manning was drafted by the [[San Diego Chargers]] with the first overall pick in the [[2004 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sdsucks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/chargers/20050921-9999-1s21manning1.html|title=Nothing personal, San Diego; Eli Manning just didn't want to be a Charger|author=Jerry Magee|publisher=UNION-TRIBUNE|accessdate=2008-02-09|date=2005-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a [[Manning-Rivers trade|draft-day trade]] sent Manning to the Giants in return for the fourth overall pick [[Philip Rivers]], a third round selection in the [[2004 NFL Draft]] and the Giants' first- and fifth-round picks in the [[2005 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sdsucks&quot;/&gt;

==College career==
[[Image:Elimanning1.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Eli Manning during his tenure at Ole Miss.]]
Prior to deciding which college to attend, Manning received a call from [[David Cutcliffe]], formerly the offensive coordinator at the [[University of Tennessee]]. Cutcliffe had been hired as the head coach at [[University of Mississippi|Ole Miss]] and had previously helped Eli's older brother [[Peyton Manning|Peyton]] improve his game. Upon learning Cutcliffe was now in charge of the Rebel program, the 18-year-old followed his father’s footsteps, and made his way to Oxford, Mississippi.&lt;ref name=&quot;jockbio&quot;/&gt;

During his football career at Ole Miss, Eli set or tied 45 single-game, season, and career records. His career numbers include 10,119 passing yards (fifth on the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] career list), 81 touchdown passes (third on the SEC career list), and a passer rating of 137.7 (tied for sixth on the SEC career list). Manning also led the Rebels to a 10-3 record and a 31-28 [[AT&amp;T|SBC]] [[Cotton Bowl (game)|Cotton Bowl]] victory over the [[Oklahoma State Cowboys]] in 2003. He was invited to play in the 2004 [[Senior Bowl]], but chose not to play.&lt;ref name=&quot;nflplayers&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--ref is for entire paragraph--&gt;

As his senior year came to a close, Eli won many awards including the Maxwell Award as the nation’s best all-around player, the [[Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award]], the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame Scholar Athlete Award, the Sporting News Radio Socrates Award, and the SEC Player of the Year. He was also a candidate for the Heisman Trophy but voters chose Oklahoma's quarterback [[Jason White (American football)|Jason White]] (1,481 voting points) to win the award. Eli had 710 voting points making him third behind White and Pittsburgh's sophomore wide receiver [[Larry Fitzgerald]].&lt;ref name=&quot;heisman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegefootballpoll.com/2003_archive_awards.html|title=Heisman Won By A QB For 4th Straight Year
|author=Matt James|publisher=CollegeFootballPoll.com|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2003-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manning graduated from the [[University of Mississippi]] with a degree in Marketing and a [[Grade (education)#United States|GPA]] of 3.44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/2004/draft/players/32061.html|title=ELI MANNING Bio|author=SI.com|publisher=SI.com|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first half of his rookie year, Manning was tutored by veteran player [[Kurt Warner]].  After two tough defeats in the middle of the 2004 campaign, first year New York Giants coach [[Tom Coughlin]]&lt;ref name=&quot;sdsucks&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;coughlin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2004/01/06/coughlin040106.html|title=Giants hire Coughlin as head coach|author=Sports Network|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2004-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; decided to start Eli against the [[Atlanta Falcons]].  Despite several poor performances, Eli finished the season with three successive solid games against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Cincinnati Bengals]], and [[Dallas Cowboys]]. On [[January 2]], [[2005]], playing against Dallas, Eli led the Giants in a last-minute touchdown drive to end an eight-game losing streak with a 28-24 victory, making him victorious as a starter for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallas05&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=250102019|title=Dallas Cowboys versus New York Giants Box Score|author=|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=2008-02-09|date=2005-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 season: NFC East champions===
{{see also|2005 New York Giants season}}

Following 2004, Kurt Warner voided the last year of his contract&lt;ref name=&quot;warner&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1955151|title=Warner won't be Eli's backup for next year|author=Associated Press|publisher=sports.espn.go.com|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2004-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Eli was named the starter for 2005.  Manning led the Giants to a 2-0 record with victories against the Cardinals and Saints,&lt;ref name=&quot;sdsucks&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;giants lead&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/giants/2005-09-20-hot-start_x.htm|title=At 2-0, Giants taking baby steps toward bigger things|author=Stephen Edelson|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2005-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; before traveling to the west coast for a test in San Diego.
Chargers fans did not forget the snub, and on [[September 25]], [[2005]] when Eli and the Giants made their first trip to San Diego for a game since that draft day, the crowd booed Manning loudly every time he touched the ball. San Diego defeated the Giants,&lt;ref name=&quot;chargers05&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giants.com/gameday/2005Week3GiantsatChargers.asp|title=Giants Fall to Chargers, 45-23|author=|publisher=giants.com|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2005-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 45-23, but Eli displayed what may have been his most impressive performance of his young career, going 24-41 for 352 yards and two touchdowns.&lt;ref name=&quot;inside story&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giants.com/news/eisen/story.asp?story_id=9181|title=Chargers 45, Giants 23: Inside the Numbers!|author=Michael Eisen|publisher=giants.com|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2005-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his performance at San Diego, Manning returned home to throw for almost 300 yards and a career high four touchdowns against the Rams at Giants stadium in a 44-24 romp.&lt;ref name=&quot;rams05&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=251002019|title=Giants versus Rams recap|author=|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two games later, he led a brilliant last-minute drive against the Broncos to secure a 24-23 victory for the Giants.&lt;ref name=&quot;broncos05&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=251023019|title=Giants versus Broncos recap|author=|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The drive culminated in a two yard touchdown to [[Amani Toomer]] with 8 seconds remaining.&lt;ref name=&quot;broncos05&quot;/&gt; The following week, Manning overcame a weak first half at San Francisco to help his team secure their first official road victory of the season, 24-6.  Despite a poor performance at home against the Vikings, throwing four interceptions, he again led his team back to tie the game in the final minutes before Minnesota won on a late field goal.

Eli's second season was largely a success. He finished in the top 5 in both passing yards and touchdown passes, while leading an offense that finished 3rd in the NFL in scoring, with a total of 422 points. It was the most points the Giants scored in a single season since [[1963]]. The Giants won the NFC East with an 11-5 record,&lt;ref name=&quot;05finalstats&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teamgiants.com/05reviews.htm|title=2005 NFC East Final Standings|author=|publisher=Team Giants.com|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went to the postseason.

The one knock on Eli during his first full season was his efficiency. Even though the Giants finished at the top of the NFC East, Manning himself struggled during his first full year as starting quarterback. Eli completed just 52.8% of his passes with a modest 6.8 yards per attempt, producing an unimpressive quarterback efficiency rating of 75.9 (23rd in the league), leading many sports commentators to question his abilities. Manning visibly wore down late in the season. His play fell off, culminating in a poor performance in the playoffs against Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aceonsports.com/2006/01/relax-giants-fans-eli-is-still-man.html|title=Relax Giants fans, Eli is still the man|accessdate=2007-10-31|publisher=AceOnSports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 season===
{{see also|2006 New York Giants season}}
Manning's second full season was reminiscent of his 2005 campaign. He started off playing well and completed over 65 percent of his passes through the first four games. However, he struggled in the second half of the season and his production diminished towards the end of the regular season. After losing a tough game to his brother Peyton and the [[Indianapolis Colts|Colts]] on opening day&lt;ref name=&quot;firstday06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/nfl/20060908-0112-fbn-giants-ratingeli.html|title=Hype aside, Colts game should offer gauge of Eli Manning's progress|author=David Porter|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Eli and the Giants rebounded from a 24-7 4th-quarter deficit en route to a 30-24 overtime victory over the division rival [[Philadelphia Eagles|Eagles]] in week two.&lt;ref name=&quot;eagles06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=128825&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=55&amp;sid=b0aa526e99d0546d163f214137dfff17|title=Eagles can't stop Eli Manning's OT rally |author=|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;Manning threw for a career high 371 yards in the win with three touchdowns including a game winning pass to [[Plaxico Burress]] in overtime.&lt;ref name=&quot;eagles06-2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/recap?gid=20060917021|title=NY Giants 30, Philadelphia 24, OT|author=Rob Maaddi|publisher=AP Sports|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a poor performance against [[Seattle Seahawks|Seattle]] the next week&lt;ref name=&quot;seahawks06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/boxscore?gid=20060924026|title=Seattle 42, NY Giants 30|author=|publisher=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Manning and the Giants responded by winning five straight games including wins over the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]], [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] and [[Atlanta Falcons|Falcons]] to push their record to 6-2.&lt;ref name=&quot;biggame06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20061112/news_lz1s12biggame.html|title=Today's big game: Bears (7-1) at Giants (6-2)|author=Joe Pascale|publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following this winning streak, key injuries including one to receiver [[Amani Toomer]] pushed Eli Manning and the Giants into a downward slide. &lt;ref name=&quot;toomer06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/giants/2006-11-08-toomer-injury_x.htm|title=Giants receiver Amani Toomer out for year with knee injury|author=Tom Canavan|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing against the [[Chicago Bears]], Manning started well, but the Giant's offense was derailed by the loss of left tackle [[Luke Petitgout]] to a broken leg.&lt;ref name=&quot;petitgout06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2659628|title=Depleted Giants lose Petitgout to fractured left leg|author=ESPN.com news services|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manning was held to only 141 yards passing with two interceptions. Petigout's loss left a gaping hole at the crucial left tackle position, and Manning was unable to repeat his first half success. Manning struggled the next week at [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jacksonville]]&lt;ref name=&quot;jags06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores106/106324/NFL702292.htm|title=Box Score|author=|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the week after that, a costly interception helped to culminate a huge collapse at [[Tennessee Titans|Tennessee]], with the Giants seeing a 21-point fourth quarter lead simply evaporate.&lt;ref name=&quot;titans06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/28/sports/football/28giants.html?_r=1&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/M/Manning,%20Eli&amp;oref=slogin|title=Day After Debacle, the Giants Close Ranks|author=John Branch|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manning improved the following week, throwing for 270 yards and two touchdowns, but the Giants lost again.  Finally regaining momentum, Manning threw three touchdowns in a win at [[Carolina Panthers|Carolina]]&lt;ref name=&quot;panthers06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports-att.espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=261210029|title=NY Giants 27, Carolina 13|author=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2006-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but then he stumbled badly in the final three games. He threw two interceptions against the Eagles and tallied only 73 passing yards in a game against the [[New Orleans Saints|Saints]]. Although the Giants battled back to 8-8 the following week at Washington, Manning completed only 12 of 26 passes for 101 yards and one touchdown. The Giants qualified for the postseason and met the Eagles again. Although he did significantly better in this game than the 2005 playoff matchup, completing 16 of 27 passes and two touchdowns, the Giants lost to a last second field goal by the Eagles.&lt;ref name=&quot;playoffs06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=270107021|title=Westbrook, Garcia keep streaking Eagles' train rolling|author=|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the year, Manning threw for 3,244 yards, 24 touchdowns and 18 interceptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;totalstats06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/stats?playerId=5526|title=#10 Eli Manning QB 
|author=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2008-01-22|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed 57.7 percent of his passes, a five point improvement from 2005, but he again struggled badly in the second half of the season. Manning finished the season with a mediocre quarterback efficiency rating of 77.0 (18th in the league) thanks to a lackluster 6.2 yards per attempt. He was generally perceived to be a solid quarterback, but he lacked the more notable successes of fellow 2004 draftees [[Phillip Rivers]] (for whom he was traded) and [[Ben Roethlisberger]].

On the following drive, however, Manning again connected with [[David Tyree]] on a play in which he avoided several near-[[Quarterback sacks|sacks]] and Tyree caught the ball off his helmet for a large gain.

The '''United States presidential election of 2008''', scheduled for Tuesday, [[November 4]] , [[2008]] &lt;i&gt;[http://www.timeanddate.com/counters/customcounter.html?month=11&amp;day=4&amp;year=2008&amp;hour=8&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p0=179 (countdown)]&lt;/i&gt; , will be the 56th consecutive [[wikt:quadrennial|quadrennial]] [[United States presidential election]] and will select the [[President of the United States]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] of the [[United States]]. The two [[major party|major parties]]' candidates have not been officially chosen, but their presumptive nominees are [[John McCain]], the senior [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Arizona]], for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and [[Barack Obama]], the junior United States Senator from [[Illinois]], for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The 2008 election is particularly notable because it is the first time in U.S. history that two sitting senators will run against each other for president&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and because it will be the first time an [[African American]] will be a presidential nominee for a major party. 

The [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] has nominated former [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Bob Barr]], the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] has nominated pastor and radio talk show host [[Chuck Baldwin]], and the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] has nominated former Congresswoman [[Cynthia McKinney]]. [[Ralph Nader]] declined to seek the Green Party nomination and is running as an [[independent (politician)|independent candidate]].

The election will coincide with the [[United States Senate elections, 2008|2008 Senate elections]] in thirty-three states, [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2008|House of Representatives elections]] in all states, and [[United States gubernatorial elections, 2008|gubernatorial elections]] in eleven states, as well as various state [[referendum]]s and local elections.

As in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], the allocation of electoral votes to each state will be based partially on the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 Census]]. The president-elect and vice president-elect are scheduled to be inaugurated on [[January 20]], [[2009]].

==Characteristics==
===No incumbents===
The 2008 election marks the first time since the [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928 election]] in which neither an [[incumbent]] president nor an incumbent vice president ran for their party's nomination in the presidential election,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Toby |last=Harnden |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1435447/The-top-US-conservatives-and-liberals.html |title=The top US conservatives and liberals |accessdate=2008-01-10 |date=2007-11-13 |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first time since the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 election]] that neither the incumbent President nor incumbent Vice President is a candidate in the general election. The [[incumbent]] President, [[George W. Bush]], is serving his second term and is barred from running again by the [[term limits]] in the [[22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] has chosen not to seek the presidency.

====Absence of Vice President====
In the three previous two-term Presidential [[Administration (government)|administrations]] &amp;mdash; those of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Bill Clinton]] &amp;mdash; the incumbent vice president has immediately thereafter run for president. [[Richard Nixon]] lost the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 election]], [[George H. W. Bush]] won the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 election]], and [[Al Gore]] lost the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historicalresults&quot;&gt; &quot;[http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html Historical Election Results: Electoral College Box Scores 1789-1996]&quot;, [[U.S. Electoral College]] / [[Office of the Federal Register]], [[U.S. National Archives and Records Administration]].
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2000results&quot;&gt;
&quot;[http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores2.html Historical Election Results: Electoral College Box Scores 2000-2004]&quot;, [[U.S. Electoral College]] / [[Office of the Federal Register]], [[U.S. National Archives and Records Administration]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
From 2001, Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] frequently stated he would never run for President: &quot;I will say just as hard as I possibly know how to say... [[Shermanesque statement|If nominated, I will not run; if elected, I will not serve]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,146546,00.html |title=Transcript: Vice President Cheney on 'FOX News Sunday' |accessdate=2008-08-25 |date=2005-02-07 |publisher=FOXNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 election is the first in which the Vice President is not a candidate for either the presidency or the vice presidency since [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in 1976.

===Leading candidates are senators===
Following the [[June 3]] Democratic primaries, the presumptive nominees for the major party nominations were both serving United States Senators: Republican candidate [[John McCain]] ([[Arizona]]) and Democratic candidate [[Barack Obama]] ([[Illinois]]). If this holds, it will be the first time in history that the two main opponents in the general election are both sitting Senators. Therefore, it appears virtually certain that the 2008 election will mark the first time since the election of [[John F. Kennedy]] in [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]] that a sitting Senator will be elected President of the United States, and only the third time ever in American history, after John F. Kennedy and [[Warren G. Harding]]. Obama's running mate, [[Joe Biden]] of [[Delaware]], is also a sitting senator.

===Leading candidates' origins and age===
Either candidate would become the first president born outside the [[Continental United States]], as Obama was born in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] and McCain was born at [[Coco Solo]], [[Panama Canal Zone]], a US naval base. A bipartisan legal review agreed that McCain is a [[natural-born citizen]] of the United States, a constitutional requirement to become president.&lt;ref&gt;Sidoti, Liz. [http://www.wtopnews.com/?sid=1354301&amp;nid=213 &quot;Senate agrees McCain is eligible for presidency&quot;], Associated Press ([[2008-03-27]]). Retrieved [[2008-04-18]].&lt;/ref&gt; Obama, having a [[White American|white]] mother and [[Kenya]]n father of the [[Luo (Kenya and Tanzania)|Luo ethnic group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Derek | last=Kilner | title=Kenyans Welcome Obama's Democratic Party Nomination | date=[[June 4]] [[2008]] | url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-06/2008-06-04-voa44.cfm?CFID=30257441&amp;CFTOKEN=32989567 | work=VOA News | accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be the first president to be [[Black people|black]] and to be [[Multiracial|biracial]]. McCain would be the first president from [[Arizona]], while Obama would be the third president from [[Illinois]], the first two being [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. The last candidates to run from these states were [[Adlai Stevenson]] (D) of Illinois, who ran and lost in [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952]] and [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956]], and [[Barry Goldwater]] (R) of Arizona, who ran and lost in [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]].

Also, if inaugurated on [[January 20]], [[2009]], McCain would be the oldest U.S. president upon [[List of United States Presidents by age|ascension to the presidency]] at age 72&amp;nbsp;years and 144&amp;nbsp;days,&lt;ref&gt;Bash, Dana. [http://edition.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/08/29/mccain.birthday/index.html &quot;With McCain, 72 is the new... 69?&quot;], CNN ([[2006-09-04]]). Retrieved [[2008-05-10]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the second-oldest president to be inaugurated ([[Ronald Reagan]] was 73&amp;nbsp;years and 350&amp;nbsp;days old at his second inauguration).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/archivesearch?q=%2273+years+and+350+days+old+Monday%22&amp;hl=en&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8 &quot;Presidential Inaugural Facts&quot;], ''Miami Herald'' ([[1985-01-20]]). Excerpt via Google News. Retrieved [[2008-03-30]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Barack Obama and John McCain are 24&amp;nbsp;years and 340&amp;nbsp;days apart in age. This is the largest age disparity between the two major party presidential candidates, surpassing [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Bob Dole]] (23&amp;nbsp;years and 28&amp;nbsp;days apart in age) who ran against each other in [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]].

===Candidates switching parties===
Former ambassador [[Alan Keyes]], former Congressman [[Bob Barr]], and [[Wayne Allyn Root]] left the Republican Party to join or seek the nomination of a third party. Keyes was defeated at the [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]] National Convention and is currently running as the nominee of the [[America's Independent Party]]. Bob Barr became the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] nominee, and Root became Barr's running mate.

Former Congresswoman [[Cynthia McKinney]] and former Senator [[Mike Gravel]] left the Democratic Party to join or seek the nomination of a third party. McKinney won the nomination of the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]], and Gravel lost his bid for the Libertarian nomination after being eliminated in the fourth round of voting.

&quot;Front runner&quot; status is dependent on the news agency reporting, but by October 2007, the consensus listed about six candidates as leading the pack. For example, CNN listed [[Hillary Clinton]], [[John Edwards]], [[Rudolph Giuliani]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Fred Thompson]], and [[Mitt Romney]] as the front runners.
''[[The Washington Post]]'' listed Clinton, Edwards and Obama as the Democratic frontrunners, &quot;leading in polls and fundraising and well ahead of the other major candidates&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Three candidates, Clinton, Obama, and Romney, raised over $20 million in the first three months of 2007, and three others, Edwards, Giuliani, and McCain, raised over $12 million; the next closest candidate was [[Bill Richardson]], who raised over $6 million.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;[http://projects.washingtonpost.com/2008-presidential-candidates/finance/2007/q1/ Campaign Finance: First Quarter 2007 FEC Filings]&quot;, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the third quarter of 2007, the top four GOP fund raisers were Romney, Giuliani, Thompson, and [[Ron Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8SO0SCG0&amp;show_article=1 |title=Paul Raises More Than $3.5M in One Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul set the GOP record for the largest online single day fund raising on [[November 5]], [[2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/onpolitics/2007/11/ron-paul-says-h.html|title=Ron Paul says he's broken one-day online fundraising record}} See also: {{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/Story?id=3822989&amp;page=1 |title=Who are Ron Paul's Donors? |author=Z.

===Primaries and caucuses===
{{main|Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008}}
Although the nomination process for each of the two major political parties technically continues through June, in previous cycles the candidates have been effectively chosen by the March primaries. This trend continued in 2008 on the Republican side, with John McCain locking up the nomination with victories in [[Texas]] and [[Ohio]] on [[March 4]], but Democrat Barack Obama did not win the nomination until [[June 3]], after a long campaign against Hilary Clinton. Obama has a wide lead in states won, but Democratic state delegate contests have been decided by a form of [[proportional representation]] since 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.niu.edu/1991/ii911010.html |title=The 1992 primary: proportional representation for Illinois Democrats |first=John S. |last=Jackson |coauthors=Barbara Leavitt Brown |work=Illinois Issues |date=1991-10-12 |accessdate=2008-05-18 |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Springfield]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton claimed a lead in the popular vote, but the [[Associated Press]] found her numbers accurate only in one very close scenario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtop.com/?nid=213&amp;sid=1404782 Fact check: Clinton vote claims under scrutiny]&quot;, ''[[WTOP-FM|WTOP News]]'', [[Associated Press]], [[May 15]], [[2008]]. [http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080515/ap_on_el_pr/popular_vote_fact_check Alternate link]{{Dead link|date=August 2008}}, ''[[Yahoo! News]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During late 2007, both parties adopted rules against states moving their primaries to an earlier date in the year. For the Republicans, the penalty for this violation is supposed to be the loss of half the state party's delegates to the convention. The Democratic Party only allowed four states to hold elections before [[February 5]], [[2008]]. Initially the Democratic Party leadership said it would strip all Democratic delegates from [[Florida]] and [[Michigan]], which had moved their primaries all the way into January. All major candidates agreed officially not to campaign in Florida or Michigan, and Edwards and Obama had their names removed from the Michigan ballot. Clinton won a majority of delegates from both states (though 40 percent voted uncommitted) and subsequently led a fight to fully seat the Florida and Michigan delegates.
&lt;ref&gt;Hertzberg, Hendrik ([[2008]]-[[06-02]])[http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2008/06/02/080602taco_talk_hertzberg &quot;Memory Lapse&quot;], The New Yorker.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

Political columnist Christopher Weber notes that while this was self-serving, it was also pragmatic on the part of Clinton should Florida or Michigan voters have not voted for Democrats in the general election based on the Democratic Party's decision regarding the seating of delegates. &lt;ref&gt;Weber, Christopher ([[2008]]-[[05-28]]) [http://news.aol.com/political-machine/2008/05/25/why-hillary-continues-to-run-by-hillary/12 'Why Hillary Continues To Run' by Hillary], www.aol.com/news&lt;/ref&gt; This led to speculation that the fight over the delegates could last until the convention in August. However, on [[May 31]], [[2008]], a deal was reached by the Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic Party that allows for delegates from Michigan and Florida to receive half a vote each. &lt;ref&gt;Cornish, Audie and Greene, David ([[2008]]-[[06-01]]) [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91041000 DNC Strikes Deal on Florida, Michigan Delegates], www.npr.org&lt;/ref&gt;

====January 2008====
Around the start of the year, support for [[Mike Huckabee]] and [[Barack Obama]] began rising in the polls, passing longtime front runners Romney and Clinton for first place in [[Iowa caucuses|Iowa]]: the two upstart campaigns were triumphant. Suddenly John McCain displaced Rudy Giuliani and Romney as the front-runner in [[New Hampshire]].

While Huckabee had little money and was hoping for a third place finish, Obama was the new front runner in New Hampshire and the Clinton campaign was struggling. However, in a turning point for her campaign, Clinton's voice wavered with emotion in a public interview broadcast live on TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article3160177.ece |title=Hillary Clinton: my teary moment won me New Hampshire|date=2008-01-09|author=Hannah Strange and Philippe Naughton|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2008-03-14}} See also: {{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqGl-pDnYMQ|title=Hillary tears up in New Hampshire Primary 2008|format=Video|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of that day, Clinton won the primary by 2 points, contrary to the predictions of pollsters who had her as much as twelve points behind on the day of the primary itself. McCain also staged a turnaround victory, having been written off by the pundits and in single digits less than a month before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22641730/|title=New poll finds McCain reshaping GOP race|work=[[MSNBC]]|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|author=Robin Toner and Marjorie Connelly|date=2008-01-14|accessdate=2008-03-14}} See also: {{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=4288771|title=John McCain: Ultimate Survivor|date=2008-03-06|work=[[The Star (South Africa)]]|accessdate=2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Republicans stripping Michigan and Florida of half their delegates, the Republican race was based there, while the Democrats focused on [[Nevada Democratic caucuses, 2008|Nevada]] and [[South Carolina Democratic primary, 2008|South Carolina]], which were given special permission to have early contests. In South Carolina Obama got 55% of the vote. Meanwhile, McCain managed a small victory in South Carolina, setting him up for a larger and more important victory in Florida soon after.

====February 2008====
On [[February 3]] on the [[UCLA]] campus, celebrities [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Caroline Kennedy]] and [[Stevie Wonder]], among others, made appearances to show support for [[Barack Obama]] in a rally led by [[Michelle Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZiNtTq10i0|title=LA rally - Full Video|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama trailed in the California polling by an average of 6.0%; he ended up losing [[California]] by 8.3%.&lt;ref name=&quot;fivethirtyeight1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/08/persistent-myth-of-bradley-effect.html|title=The Persistent Myth of the Bradley Effect|author=Nate Silver|date=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some analysts cited a large [[Latino]] turnout as the deciding factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.californiaprogressreport.com/2008/02/clinton_win_in.html|title=Clinton Win in California Larger Than Polls Predicted Because of Huge Latino Turnout|author=Frank D. Russo|date=2008-02-06|accessdate=2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Republican side, John McCain was endorsed by [[Governor of California|California Governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Rudy Giuliani]] (who had dropped out of the race following the Florida primary), giving McCain a significant boost in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/31/mccain.endorsements/index.html|title=Schwarzenegger backs McCain for president|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarzenegger's wife, [[Maria Shriver]], endorsed Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/02/03/shriver.obama/|title=Maria Shriver endorses Obama|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[February 4]], it was apparent that McCain might be able to wrap up the nomination quickly, while the Democratic candidates were hoping for a swing of momentum following the February 5th primaries.

[[Super Tuesday (2008)|'''Super Tuesday''']]: On [[February 5]], [[2008]], the largest-ever simultaneous number of state [[U.S. presidential primary|U.S. presidential primary elections]] was held.&lt;ref name=&quot;SJFPPbbc&quot;&gt;

[[Louisiana]] and [[Washington]] voted for both parties on [[February 9]], while [[Nebraska]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] voted for the Democrats and [[Kansas]] voted for the Republicans. Obama swept all four Democratic contests, as well as the Maine caucuses the next day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/state/#ME|title=Election Center 2008: Primary Results from Maine|work=[[CNN]]|date=2008-02-10|accessdate=2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Huckabee also came out on top in Kansas, winning by an even greater percentage. The District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia voted for both parties on [[February 12]] in the so-called [[Potomac primary]]. Obama won all three for the Democrats (giving him eight consecutive victories after Super Tuesday) and McCain took all three for the Republicans.

Obama carried both [[Hawaii]] and [[Wisconsin]], the last two states that voted for the Democrats in February, on the 19th.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc21660914&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[MSNBC]]|title=2008 Primary Results|accessdate=2008-03-14|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21660914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wisconsin and Washington (primary) voted for the Republicans on [[February 19]]; John McCain won these states.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc21660914&quot;/&gt; The Virgin Islands and [[Puerto Rico]] closed February for the Republicans, on the 23rd and 24th.

====March 2008====
For the Republicans, on [[March 1]] [[American Samoa]] voted. March 4 was dubbed by some as this year's [[Super Tuesday II, 2008|Mini Tuesday]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecitizens.blogspot.com/2008/02/mini-tuesday-sideshow.html|title=Mini Tuesday Sideshow|publisher= The Citizens (blog)|accessdate=2008-03-14}} See also: {{cite web|url=http://www.electoral-vote.com/|title=Democratic Primaries And Caucuses 2008|accessdate=2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the delegate-rich states of Texas and Ohio, along with Rhode Island and Vermont, voted for both parties. Wyoming then voted for the Democrats and Guam voted for the Republicans on [[March 8]]. Mississippi voted on [[March 11]].

On [[March 4]], Hillary Clinton carried Ohio and Rhode Island in the Democratic primaries; some considered this a surprise upset,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton comeback: Fight goes on |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=2008-03-05 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2004261471_elexdems05.html |accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; though she led in the polling averages in both states.&lt;ref name=&quot;fivethirtyeight1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=SuperTuesdayIIresults&gt;{{cite news |title=Clinton wins key primaries, CNN projects; McCain clinches nod |work=[[CNN]] |date=2008-03-05 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/04/march.4.contests/ |accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also carried the primary in Texas, but Obama won the Texas caucuses held the same day and netted more delegates from the state than Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title= Election Center 2008 Primaries and Caucuses: Results: Democratic Scorecard | date= (regularly updated) |  publisher= | url =  http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/scorecard/#D | work = [[CNN]] | pages = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; John McCain clinched the Republican nomination after sweeping all four primaries, Texas, Ohio, Vermont and Rhode Island, putting him over the top of the 1,191 delegates required to win the GOP nomination.&lt;ref name=SuperTuesdayIIresults /&gt; Mike Huckabee conceded the race to McCain, leaving Ron Paul, who had just 16 delegates, as his only remaining opponent for the Republican nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Huckabee bows to 'inevitable,' ends GOP run |work=[[CNN]] |date=2008-03-05 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/05/huckabee/ |accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Wyoming Democratic caucuses, Obama edged out Clinton to gain 7 delegates to her 5, and three days later he beat her again, 59%–39%, in Mississippi.

====April through June 2008====
Only one state voted in April: [[Pennsylvania]], which held a primary for both parties on April 22. Hillary Clinton won this Democratic primary, with approximately 55% of the vote. Barack Obama won the [[Guam]] caucuses on [[May 3]] by 7 votes out of more than 4,500. On [[May 6]], Hillary Clinton won the [[Indiana]] primary with 51% of the vote while Barack Obama won in [[North Carolina]] with 56% of the vote. Nebraska's Republican and West Virginia's Democratic primaries were held on [[May 13]]. In West Virginia, Clinton won with 67% of the vote and 20 of 28 pledged delegates. On [[May 20]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Oregon]] held primaries for both parties. In Kentucky, Clinton won with 65% of the vote to Obama's 31%. In Oregon, Obama defeated Clinton, by a margin of 18%. [[Idaho]] voted for Republicans only on [[May 27]]. On [[May 31]], Democratic Party officials, after a tense meeting between Clinton supporters and Obama backers, voted to seat all of Florida and Michigan's delegates at the party's convention, with each getting a half-vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/05/31/dems.delegates/index.html|title=Florida, Michigan get all delegates, but each gets half vote|publisher= CNN.com|accessdate=2008-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Puerto Rico Democratic primary, 2008|Puerto Rico]] held a Democratic primary on [[June 1]], which Clinton won with 68% of the vote to Obama's 32%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5i23h4XqvR0Ph96aWYyZ4PgI54YCwD911P1IO0|title=Clinton wins Puerto Rico but Obama gains delegates|publisher= Associated Press|accessdate=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2008}} The primary season ended on [[June 3]], with contests in [[New Mexico Republican caucuses, 2008|New Mexico]] (Republican), [[Montana Democratic primary, 2008|Montana]] (Democratic), and [[South Dakota]] (both parties). Clinton won South Dakota's primary, while Obama was victorious in the Montana primary. As expected, John McCain won all the states during this time period handily, though typically 20-25% of the vote in the Republican primaries went to Huckabee and Paul, despite the fact both had already been mathematically eliminated from contention for the nomination.

==Possible electoral college changes==
===National Popular Vote Interstate Compact===
{{main|National Popular Vote Interstate Compact}}
The Compact, if passed by states representing a controlling majority of the electoral college, would require states cast their electoral votes for the national popular winner, essentially shifting the election to a popular vote. As of May 2008, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey have enacted the law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/14/nyregion/14mbrfs-electoral.html |title=Trenton: State Backs Electoral College Change |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[Associated Press|AP]] |date=2008-01-14 |accessdate=2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/01/13/politics/main3706884.shtml |title=New Jersey Rejects Electoral College: Two States Have Now Joined Compact To Give Their Votes To Winner Of The Popular Vote |work=[[CBS News]] |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=2008-01-13 |accessdate=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing 50 of the required 270 votes for the Compact to take effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/pages/misc/onesixth.php |title=One-sixth of the way to 270 Electoral Votes |work=NationalPopularVote.com |date=2008-05-01 |accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act===
In 2007, Delegate [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] (D-[[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]) introduced the &quot;[[District of Columbia vote in the United States House of Representatives|DC House Voting Rights Act]]&quot; in the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|110|H.R.|1905|}}&lt;/ref&gt; If enacted, the act would have the effect of increasing the size of the electoral college by one. The bill's primary purpose is to give House representation to the District of Columbia, alongside an additional electoral college vote award to [[Utah]] in order to balance the addition. The effect is valid only until the [[United States Census, 2010|next census]], when the extra seat will be reapportioned like all other seats. The likely outcome of the change, if enacted, on the 2008 presidential election would be to give a +1 advantage to the Republican candidate: Utah has not been carried by a Democratic presidential candidate since the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 election]], and in the most recent election gave the Republican 71% of the vote. Even though the size of the electoral college would increase to 539, a candidate would still need 270 electoral votes to win. The bill has not been brought back up for vote discussion since it was nearly clotured in September 2007.

===Presidential Election Reform Act (California)===
{{see|Presidential Election Reform Act}}
There was a proposed [[California ballot proposition|initiative]] in the state of California to alter the way the state's electoral votes for president are distributed among presidential candidates, but the initiative failed to get onto the 2008 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Shane Goldmacher |url=http://sacbee.com/static/weblogs/capitolalertlatest/010429.html |work= [[The Sacramento Bee]] |title=Electoral college measure falls short |date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

]]
Political experts have identified certain [[swing state]]s where close votes might prove crucial to the outcome of the election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electoral-vote.com/ Election 2008: Presidential, Senate and House Races Updated Daily]&lt;/ref&gt; These states may include, but are certainly not limited to:

:''Electoral College votes in parentheses''
*'''[[Colorado]]''': (9) The Centennial State is holding its second [[Democratic National Convention]] in Denver after 100 years. The election of [[Ken Salazar]], a Hispanic-American to the U.S. Senate; [[Bill Ritter (politician)|Bill Ritter]] to the Governorship in 2006 and a U.S. House seat pick-up in 2006 made it a prized apple for the Democrats, prompting DNC Chairman [[Howard Dean]] to claim that the West holds the key to victory in 2008, which effectively made [[Denver]] the location of the Convention. A strong [[Hispanic-American]] concentration and the attention brought to bear on such issues as immigration reform, [[labor union]] support and minimum wage have made this a possible Democratic state. Recent polls show Colorado as a toss-up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colorado: McCain vs. Obama&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/co/colorado_mccain_vs_obama-546.html |title=RealClearPolitics - Election 2008 - Colorado: McCain vs. Obama&lt;!- Bot generated title -&gt; |accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Florida]]''': (27) The key player in 2000, whose votes went — narrowly and controversially — to [[George W. Bush]], making him the effective winner. Experts agree that the winner of Florida will have a significant advantage towards advancing to the [[White House]]. Florida has trended toward the Republican Party since 2000. For Democrats, the vote of the elderly is seen as a potential boon, due to the party's traditional stance on [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] (two key components of winning the elderly vote), while Republicans have an advantage with their stance on tax cuts and values issues. The [[Hispanic]] and African American populations in Florida could also give the Democrats an edge in a close race. For Republicans, the business attention of tax cuts and [[Cuban-American]] attention has made it a strong contender. Current polls show McCain with a slight average lead in Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;Florida: McCain vs. Obama&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/fl/florida_mccain_vs_obama-418.html |title=RealClearPolitics - Election 2008 - Florida: McCain vs. Obama&lt;!- Bot generated title -&gt; |accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Indiana]]''': (11) The state has not voted for a Democratic Presidential Nominee since [[Lyndon Johnson]] in 1964, but a poll shows a generic Democrat leading a generic Republican in the Presidential election 37%-32%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2007/11/indiana_an_emerging_purple_sta.html |title=Indiana: An Emerging Purple State? |author= Chris Cillizza |work= [[The Fix (blog)|The Fix]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post]]| date=2007-11-27| accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another poll by the [[The Indianapolis Star|Indianapolis Star]] showed the [[Iraq War|War in Iraq]] and the sluggish [[Economy of the United States|economy]] to be the biggest issues among Hoosiers. Also, the poll found that a Democratic ticket featuring Indiana Senator [[Evan Bayh]] might have boosted the possibility of Indiana switching alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=War, economy have red state thinking blue | work=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |date= 2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current polls show Indiana as a pure toss-up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indianapolls&quot;&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/in/indiana_mccain_vs_obama-604.html RealClearPolitics - Election 2008 - Indiana: McCain vs. Obama]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[United States general elections, 2006|2006]], Democrats won three house seats here. Also in 2006, Democrats gained control of the [[Indiana House of Representatives|Indiana House]]. 

*'''[[Iowa]]''': (7) Iowa is a true toss up state; it went for Gore in 2000 and Bush in 2004. In 2006, Democrats retained control of the Governor's Mansion with the addition of two U.S. House seats and the election of [[Chet Culver]] as governor. Also, for the first time in four decades, Democrats gained complete control of the state legislature, further enhancing the progress of the Democrats. Still, agriculture policies and conservative values make it a magnet for the Republicans. Current polls show Barack Obama with a sizable lead in Iowa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowapolls&quot;&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/ia/iowa_mccain_vs_obama-209.html RealClearPolitics - Election 2008 - Iowa: McCain vs. Obama]&lt;/ref&gt; 

*'''[[Michigan]]''': (17) The Great Lakes State has been a fairly safe bet for the Democrats in recent decades, giving its substantial electoral votes to Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and [[John Kerry]]. However, with each election, the margin of victory has narrowed, opening a window for the Republicans. Populism and a historically strong labor movement have dominated the state and given Democrats an advantage, but Republicans have gained ground in advancing tax cuts and other social issues appealing to &quot;[[Reagan Democrat]]s&quot;. A population exodus from Democratic Detroit has made the conservative Republican west more influential. Still, Democratic governor [[Jennifer Granholm]] was soundly re-elected in 2006 despite the state having the highest unemployment rate in the country on her watch. Current polls show Michigan with a slight Obama lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michiganpolls&quot;&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/mi/michigan_mccain_vs_obama-553.html RealClearPolitics - Election 2008 - Michigan: McCain vs. Obama]&lt;/ref&gt; 

*'''[[Missouri]]''': (11) The Show Me State has been long been dubbed the [[Missouri bellwether|bellwether for the nation]] because historically it has correlated very closely with the national [[Zeitgeist]] &amp;ndash; with the single exception of 1956, Missouri has supported the winner of every Presidential election since 1904. The home state of President Harry Truman leans slightly Republican, and granted its 11 electoral votes to Bush in both 2000 and 2004. Despite the relative strength of Republicans in this Midwestern state, it has a strong penchant for advancing populist causes such as [[stem cell research]] and [[universal health care]]. In 2006, Missouri elected its first female U.S. Senator in Democrat [[Claire McCaskill]]. Moreover, the national mood souring over the [[war in Iraq]] and a contentious gubernatorial election with a Democratic favorite in [[Jay Nixon]] make this state a strong possibility for the Democrats. Current polls show John McCain with a slight average lead in Missouri. &lt;ref name=&quot;Missouripolls&quot;&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/mo/missouri_mccain_vs_obama-545.html RealClearPolitics - Election 2008 - Missouri: McCain vs. Obama]&lt;/ref&gt; 

*'''[[Nevada]]''': (5) Although Nevada has historically leaned Republican, the high concentration of labor unions and [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic-American]] vote make it a potential battleground state. (Its 2006 Gubernatorial election was particularly competitive, and Republican [[Jim Gibbons (United States politician)|Jim Gibbons]] won only by a slim margin.) The [[Las Vegas metropolitan area]] with its dramatic increase in population has become an attractive destination for Democratic campaign resources, and Republicans are buoyed by the strong disapproval ratings of Gibbons (29% approval rating as of March 2007) and Bush (34% approval rating as of March 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2007/Mar-14-Wed-2007/news/13168718.html |title=Poll: Gibbons Lagging Bush |author=Molly Ball |work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |date=2007-03-14 |accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Nevada has, with the single exception of 1976, been won by the victor of every US Presidential election since 1912, a record which makes it a secondary bellwether state. A current poll shows McCain with a slight lead in Nevada. &lt;ref name=&quot;Nevada: McCain vs. Obama&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/nv/nevada_mccain_vs_obama-252.html |title=RealClearPolitics - Election 2008 - Nevada: McCain vs. Obama&lt;!- Bot generated title -&gt; |accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[New Hampshire]]''': (4) Once very reliably Republican, New Hampshire became a swing state in the 1990s. Republicans still have somewhat of an edge in statewide elections, however the Democrats took control of the state legislature and both Congressional seats in 2006. The New Hampshire Republican Party tends to be more socially liberal than the national party, and as a result their behavior in national elections is harder to determine. New Hampshire was the only state in the nation that went for Bush in 2000 and then for Kerry in 2004, although by narrow margins both times. Current polls show New Hampshire with a slight Obama lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewHampshirepolls&quot;&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/nh/new_hampshire_mccain_vs_obama-195.html RealClearPolitics - Election 2008 - New Hampshire: McCain vs. Obama]&lt;/ref&gt; 

*'''[[New Mexico]]''': (5) New Mexico has been long eschewed as a nominal state, but that thinking has changed dramatically. With elections being heavily contested and victories being decided by two or three states, New Mexico has become one of the centers of political fighting. In 2000, Gore won by a razor-thin margin and in 2004, Bush won by a small, yet safe margin. These results have made experts conclude that New Mexico's five electoral votes, even though small in calculation, could tip the balance. New Mexico's large Hispanic and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] populations tend to vote Democrat, and could be the key for a Democratic candidate in a close race. Its penchant for populist streaks have made it an attraction for the Democrats, and Governor Bill Richardson was a contender for the 2008 nomination, and had been widely speculated as a vice presidential candidate. 

*'''[[Ohio]]''': (20) &quot;I think 2008 is very likely to be a hotly contested race in Ohio,&quot; stated Eric Rademacher, director of the [[University of Cincinnati]]'s Ohio Poll, for the [[Cincinnati Enquirer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/11/04/loc_oh2008.html |title= Intense 2008 election forecast for Ohio |author=Carl Weiser |work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] |date=2004-11-04 |accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its 20 electoral votes were critical to President Bush's reelection in 2004, and their tally was close enough to be contested. In 2006, Ohio voters elected Democrats [[Ted Strickland]] and [[Sherrod Brown]] for Governor and U.S. Senator, respectively. Current polls show McCain with a slight average lead in Ohio. &lt;ref name=&quot;Ohio: McCain vs. Obama&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/oh/ohio_mccain_vs_obama-400.html |title=RealClearPolitics - Election 2008 - Ohio: McCain vs. Obama&lt;!- Bot generated title -&gt; |accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Pennsylvania]]''': (21) Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Pedro A. Cortés stated on [[March 17]], [[2007]], that &quot;The commonwealth’s large number of electoral college votes and diverse population make Pennsylvania a key battleground state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.dos.state.pa.us/dos/lib/dos/press/2007/presidential_primary_03-13-07.pdf |title=Rendell Administration Supports Giving Pennsylvanians a Voice in Presidential Primary |format=PDF |publisher=Pennsylvania Department of State |date=2007-03-13 |accessdate=2008-08-25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Pennsylvania has leaned Democratic since 1992, giving its electoral votes to Bill Clinton (1992 and 1996), Gore (2000) and Kerry (2004).

*'''[[Virginia]]''': (13) No Democratic presidential candidate has won Virginia since Lyndon Johnson's landslide victory in 1964, and it was the only Southern state that went Republican in [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]]. Virginia is no longer as reliably Republican as it once was, as evidenced by Democrat [[Tim Kaine]]'s winning the Governor's Mansion in 2005 and [[Jim Webb]]'s narrow victory in the 2006 Senate race against incumbent Republican [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]]. Additionally, [[Northern Virginia]], the fastest-growing region in the state also is part of the [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area]] [[Highest-income metropolitan statistical areas in the United States|the second highest income metropolitan area]] in the country, tends to lean Democratic. Virginia also has a large [[African American]] population, which could benefit a Democratic candidate in a close race. Unique political timing may come into play in Virginia in 2008, as popular former governor and Democrat [[Mark Warner]] is running for the Senate in 2008 for the seat of retiring Senator [[John Warner]] (no relation). His popularity (and widely-expected victory in November) could be a significant asset to the Democratic presidential candidate in Virginia. This notion is supported by a September 2007 Rasmussen Reports poll in which Mark Warner leads former Republican governor [[Jim Gilmore]] 54% to 34%. Current polls show Virginia as a pure toss-up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Virginiapolls&quot;&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/va/virginia_mccain_vs_obama-551.html RealClearPolitics - Election 2008 - Virginia: McCain vs. Obama]&lt;/ref&gt; 

*'''[[Wisconsin]]''': (10) Among the closest states in the nation, Wisconsin very narrowly went to Gore in 2000 and Kerry in 2004. These two results were much closer than the results in prior elections, so it could be possible Wisconsin is trending Republican in presidential elections, though John Kerry won by a slightly larger margin than Gore in 2000. Current polls show Barack Obama with a sizable lead in Wisconsin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisconsinpolls&quot;&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/wi/wisconsin_mccain_vs_obama-549.html RealClearPolitics - Election 2008 - Wisconsin: McCain vs. Obama]&lt;/ref&gt; 

;Individual congressional districts
*'''[[Maine]]''', 2nd Congressional District (1): The Second Congressional District is more competitive than the state at-large or the First Congressional District, which are safely Democratic.

*'''[[Nebraska]]''', 1st and 2nd Congressional Districts (1 each): Although Nebraska has not voted for a Democrat since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and is not expected to this time around. Nebraska's rules regarding electoral votes allow for a split in the electoral vote. Since 1991, two of Nebraska's five electoral votes are awarded based on the winner of the statewide election while the other three go to the highest vote-getter in each of the state's three congressional districts. Although possible, a split in the electoral vote has not occurred in any election. However, a poll was recently published showing Obama within striking distance of McCain in two of the congressional districts with McCain leading solidly in the 3rd Congressional District and statewide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=ce13d065-9b3a-44bc-9576-24abb567a4f4|title=Results of SurveyUSA Election Poll #13966|publisher=SurveyUSA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential battleground states listed above control a total of 159 electoral votes. Of the states that are not normally expected to be competitive, 178 electoral votes ([[Alabama]], [[Alaska]], [[Arizona]], [[Arkansas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Idaho]], [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Carolina]], [[North Dakota]], [[Oklahoma]], [[South Carolina]], [[South Dakota]], [[Tennessee]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], [[West Virginia]], [[Wyoming]]) are generally inclined to go to the Republican party, while 201 ([[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Washington, DC|D.C.]], [[Delaware]], [[Hawaii]], [[Illinois]], [[Maine]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Minnesota]], [[New Jersey]], [[New York]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Vermont]], [[Washington]]) are typically expected to go to the Democrats. 

However, even some of these states may become competitive as the election progresses, and the selection of each party's vice presidential nominee could put a previously uncompetitive state or region into play. Similarly, states that are currently considered to be potential battlegrounds may become &quot;safe&quot; for one party as the election progresses. As well, because of [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]]'s unique rules regarding the electoral votes it is possible that the vote may be different throughout the districts but not throughout the State.

==Campaign details==
===Debates===
{{main|United States presidential election debates, 2008}}
In previous elections Candidates have regularly participated in debates, in some of these candidates have accepted questions from the audience in a Town Hall forum format. Unique to 2008 is the [[CNN-YouTube presidential debates]] in which the Republicans and Democrats each held debates in which questions came primarily from YouTube viewer submitted videos, with 39 questions asked of the Democrats and 31 of the Republican candidates about divisive issues respective to each party. Some argued that it gave better access to candidates from voters in states with late primaries or in states where candidates are unlikely to visit. Others cited that some questions were frivolous or may have been planted.

The first presidential debate of 2008 is scheduled for September 26 at the [[University of Mississippi]]. &lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Campaign costs===
{{Main|Fundraising for the 2008 United States presidential election}}
The reported cost of campaigning for President has increased significantly in recent years. One source reported that if the costs for both [[Democratic party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican party (United States)|Republican]] campaigns are added together (for the Presidential primary election, general election, and the political conventions) the costs have more than doubled in only eight years ($448.9 million in 1996, $649.5 million in 2000, and $1.01 billion in 2004).&lt;!--&lt;ref name=&quot;Toner&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Helen |last=Kennedy |title=Wanna be Prez? First get $100M |date=2007-01-14 |publisher=New York Daily News |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/488673p-411469c.html |accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; In January 2007, Federal Election Commission Chairman [[Michael E. Toner|Michael Toner]] estimated that the 2008 race will be a $1 billion election, and that to be taken seriously, a candidate needed to raise at least $100 million by the end of 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;1 billion election&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Kirkpatrick |title=Death Knell May Be Near for Public Election Funds|date=2007-01-23 |work=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/us/politics/23donate.html |accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he had said that he would not be running for president, published reports indicated that [[billionaire]] and New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] had been considering a presidential bid as an independent with up to $1 billion of his own fortune to finance it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Smith |title=Billion-Dollar elephant inches toward run |date=2007-06-19 |work=[[The Politico]]|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0607/4560.html |accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg ultimately ended this speculation by unequivocally stating that he would not run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bloomberg, Michael R.|title=I’m Not Running for President, but ...|date=[[February 28]], [[2008]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/opinion/28mike.html|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had Bloomberg decided to run, he would not have needed to campaign in the primary elections or participate in the conventions, greatly reducing both the necessary length and cost of his campaign.

With the increase in money, the public financing system funded by the [[presidential election campaign fund checkoff]] has not been used by many candidates. So far, John McCain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|date=2007-08-27|accessdate=2008-08-25 |url=http://www.fec.gov/press/press2007/20080828mccain.shtml |title= McCain First Presidential Candidate Declared Eligible for Primary Matching Funds in 2008 Race}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Tancredo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|date=2007-09-12|accessdate=2008-08-25 |url=http://www.fec.gov/press/press2007/20070910tancredoa.shtml |title= Tancredo Second Presidential Candidate Declared Eligible for Primary Matching Funds in 2008 Race}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Edwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|date=2007-11-01|accessdate=2008-08-25 |url=http://www.fec.gov/press/press2007/20071101edwards.shtml |title= Edwards Third Presidential Candidate Declared Eligible for Primary Matching Funds in 2008 Race}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Dodd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|date=2007-11-27|accessdate=2008-08-25 |url=http://www.fec.gov/press/press2007/20071126dodd.shtml |title= Dodd Fourth Presidential Candidate Declared Eligible for Primary Matching Funds in 2008 Race}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Joe Biden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|date=2007-12-04|accessdate=2008-08-25 |url=http://www.fec.gov/press/press2007/20071204biden.shtml |title= Biden Fifth Presidential Candidate Declared Eligible for Primary Matching Funds in 2008 Race}}&lt;/ref&gt; have qualified for and elected to take public funds in the primary. Other major candidates have eschewed the low amount of spending permitted, or gave other reasons as in the case of Barack Obama, and have chosen not to participate.

===Internet campaigns===
Howard Dean collected large contributions via the internet in his 2004 primary run. In 2008 candidates have gone even further in reaching out to Internet users through their own sites and through sites such as [[YouTube]], [[MySpace]] and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/07/23/debate.main/ |title=Questions, not answers, highlight YouTube debate |work=[[CNN]] |date=2007-07-24|accessdate=2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;garry&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/06/08/State/Candidates_court_youn.shtml |title=Candidates court young voters online|author=Stephanie Garry|work= [[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican [[Ron Paul]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/onpolitics/2007/06/ron_pauls_web_o.html |title=Ron Paul's Web of support |work=[[USA Today]]|date=2007-06-04|accessdate=2008-08-25}} See also: {{cite news |url=http://www.usnews.com/blogs/news-desk/2007/05/09/ |title=Ron Paul's Online Rise |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]|date=2007-05-09|accessdate=2008-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Democratic Party candidate [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008#Internet supporters|Barack Obama]] have been the most active in courting voters through the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitwise.com/political-data-center/key-candidates.php |title=Top Presidential Candidate 2008 Websites| publisher=[[Hitwise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 16, 2007, Ron Paul [[Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2008#Internet popularity|collected more money]] on a single day through Internet donations than any presidential candidate in US history with over $6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2007-12-17-ronpaul-fundraising_N.htm |title='Money bomb': Ron Paul raises $6 million in 24-hour period |author=Kenneth P.

Anonymous and semi-anonymous smear campaigns traditionally done with fliers and push calling have also spread to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Palmetto Bugs: Slingers of Slime Step it up in SC |last=Reid |first=Tim |date=2007-11-23 |work=[[New York Post]] |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/11232007/news/nationalnews/palmetto_bugs_188986.htm |accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of media coverage==
Significant criticism has been leveled at media outlets' poor coverage of the presidential election season.

[[ABC News]] hosted a debate in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] on [[April 16]] and moderators [[Charles Gibson]] and [[George Stephanopoulos]] were criticized by viewers, bloggers and media critics for the poor quality of their questions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who Lost&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Jacques |last=Steinberg |authorlink=Jacques Steinberg |title=Who Lost the Debate? Moderators, Many Say |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/us/politics/18moderator.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2008-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Backlash Against ABC&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Kurtz |authorlink=Howard Kurtz |title=The Backlash Against ABC |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/18/AR2008041800912.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2008-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the questions that many viewers said they considered irrelevant when measured against the faltering economy or the Iraq war, such as why Senator Barack Obama did not wear an American flag pin on his lapel, the incendiary comments of Obama’s former pastor, or Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s assertion that she had to duck sniper fire in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] more than a decade ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who Lost&quot;/&gt; The questions from the moderators were considered to be focused on campaign gaffes and trained mostly on Obama,&lt;ref name=&quot;Backlash Against ABC&quot;/&gt; which Stephanopoulos defended by saying that &quot;Senator Obama [was] the front-runner&quot; and the questions were &quot;not inappropriate or irrelevant at all&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who Lost&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Backlash Against ABC&quot;/&gt;

A similar event occurred earlier at a debate in February where [[Tim Russert]] of [[NBC News]] for what was perceived as his disproportionately tough questioning of Clinton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who Lost&quot;/&gt; Among the questions Russert had asked Clinton, but not Obama, was to provide the name of the new [[Russia]]n leader ([[Dmitry Medvedev]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Who Lost&quot;/&gt; an event which was subsequently parodied on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. In October 2007, liberal commentators accused Russert of harassing Clinton over driver's licenses for illegal immigrants and other issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Backlash Against ABC&quot;/&gt;

In an [[op-ed]] published on [[April 27]] [[2008]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Elizabeth Edwards]] bemoaned that the media covered much more of &quot;the rancor of the campaign&quot; and &quot;amount of money spent&quot; than &quot;the candidates' priorities, policies and principles&quot;. She went on to compare much of the media coverage to a [[soap opera]] and stated that, as result, &quot;voters who take their responsibility to be informed seriously enough to search out information about the candidates are finding it harder and harder to do so, particularly if they do not have access to the Internet&quot;. Edwards continued, &quot;an informed electorate is essential to freedom itself. But as long as corporations to which news gathering is not the primary source of income or expertise get to decide what information about the candidates 'sells,' we are not functioning as well as we could if we had the engaged, skeptical press we deserve&quot;. Edwards stated that what was worse is that trends hold out dim hope that the quality of media coverage will improve, stating that &quot;[[Concentration of media ownership|media consolidation]] is leading to one-size-fits-all journalism.&quot; Worst of all, she said, poor media coverage &quot;gives us permission to ignore issues and concentrate on things that don’t matter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Elizabeth Edwards |title= Op-ed: Bowling 1, Health Care 0 |publisher=NYTimes |date=2008-04-28 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/27/opinion/27edwards.html?_r=2&amp;hp=&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=print}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erica Jong]] commented that &quot;our press has become a sea of triviality, meanness and irrelevant chatter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/erica-jong/inspiration-versus-degrad_b_98844.html|title=Inspiration Versus Degradation|publication=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard University's]] [[Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy]] conducted a study of 5,374 media narratives and assertions about the presidential candidates from January 1, 2008 through March 9, 2008. The study found that Obama and Clinton received 69 and 67 percent favorable coverage, respectively, compared to only 43 percent favorable media coverage of McCain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Character and the Primaries of 2008|publisher=The Project for Excellence in Journalism|date=2008-05-29 |url=http://www.journalism.org/node/11266}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more recent study beginning on [[June 8]] done by [[The Center for Media and Public Affairs]] at [[George Mason University]] found that general election coverage on the network news, ABC, CBS, and NBC, was more biased against Obama, with 28% of the statements were positive for Obama and 72% negative, while statements on McCain were 43% positive and 57% negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-onthemedia27-2008jul27,0,712999.story|title=In study, evidence of liberal-bias bias|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|date=2008-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article covers the period starting [[May 1]], [[2003]], after United States president [[George W. Bush]] officially [[Mission Accomplished|declared]] the end of [[2003 invasion of Iraq|major combat operations]].

==Military occupation==

A [[military occupation]] was established and run by the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA), which later appointed and granted limited powers to an [[Iraq Interim Governing Council]]. Troops for the invasion came primarily from the United States, the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Poland]], but twenty-nine other nations also provided some troops, and there were varying levels of assistance from [[Deployment of Japanese troops to Iraq|Japan]] and other allied countries. Tens of thousands of private security personnel provided protection of infrastructure, facilities and personnel.

Coalition and allied Iraqi forces have been fighting a stronger-than-expected militant [[Iraqi insurgency]], and the [[reconstruction of Iraq]] has been slow. In mid-2004, the direct rule of the CPA was ended and a new &quot;sovereign and independent&quot; Interim Government of Iraq assumed the full responsibility and authority of the state. The CPA and the Governing Council were disbanded on [[June 28]], [[2004]], and a [[Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period|new transitional constitution]] came into effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpa-iraq.org/government/TAL.html Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period], [[March 8]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sovereignty was transferred to a Governing Council [[Iraqi interim government]] led by [[Iyad Allawi]] as Iraq's first post-Saddam prime minister; this government was not allowed to make new laws without the approval of the CPA. The Iraqi Interim Government was replaced as a result of the elections which took place in January 2005. A period of negotiations by the elected [[Iraqi National Assembly]] followed, which culminated on [[April 6]], [[2005]] with the selection of, among others, Prime Minister [[Ibrahim al-Jaafari]] and President [[Jalal Talabani]]. The Prime Minister al-Jaafari led the majority party of the United Iraqi Alliance (UIA), a coalition of the al-Dawa and SCIRI (Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq) parties. Both parties are Tehran backed, and were banned by Saddam Hussein.

Jalal Talabani is the long time leader of the [[Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]], one of the two main [[Kurdistan|Kurdish]] parties. The three main [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish provinces]] have extensive autonomy, with their own parliament. They have not experienced any considerable insurgency. Most Kurds welcomed the American invasion, and danced in the streets when Saddam was captured. Iraqi Kurdistan is experiencing an economic boom, with many expatriates returning home to take part in rebuilding the country that was devastated during the rule of Saddam Hussein.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Legal status of the coalition presence==
The US dominated [[Multinational force in Iraq|multinational forces]] still exercise considerable power in the country and, with the [[New Iraqi Army]], conduct military operations against the [[Iraqi insurgency]]. The role of Iraqi government forces in providing security is increasing.

According to Article 42 of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]], &quot;[[Territory (administrative division)|territory]] is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Laws of War: [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague04.htm Laws and Customs of War on Land] (Hague IV); [[October 18]], [[1907]]. The Avalon Project, Yale Law School&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Humanitarian Law]] Research Initiative states: &quot;the wording of Security Council resolution 1546&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. indicates that, regardless of how the situation is characterized, international humanitarian law will apply to it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihlresearch.org/iraq/feature.php?a=51 Research Initiative Policy Brief] (''ed''., concerning the application of international humanitarian law)&lt;/ref&gt;

:There may be situations... where the former occupier will maintain a military presence in the country, with the agreement of the legitimate government under a security arrangement (e.g., U.S. military presence in Japan and Germany). The legality of such agreement and the legitimacy of the national authorities signing it are subject to international recognition, whereby members of the international community re-establish diplomatic and political relations with the national government. In this context, it is in the interest of all the parties involved to maintain a clear regime of occupation until the conditions for stability and peace are created allowing the re-establishment of a legitimate national government. A post-occupation military presence can only be construed in the context of a viable, stable and peaceful situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | author=International Humaniatarian Law Initiative | title=Military Occupation of Iraq: Application of IHL and the Maintenance of Law and Order | date=[[April 14]], [[2003]] | url=http://www.hiciraq.org/infocentre/general/files/IHL_and_Maintenance_of_law_and_order.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UN Security Council Resolution 1546|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546]] in 2004 looked forward to the end of the occupation and the assumption of full responsibility and [[authority]] by a fully [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and independent [[Politics of Iraq|Interim Government of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usembassy.it/file2004_06/alia/a4060913.htm Iraq Resolution Endorses Plan for Transition, Elections]. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1546, [[June 8]]&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the UN and individual nations established diplomatic relations with the Interim Government and began planning for elections and the writing of a new constitution.

Despite the continuing insurgency, conditions were deemed stable enough to conduct elections, despite the objections of the United States government but pursuant to the insistence of Grand Ayatollah Sistani. John Negroponte, U.S. ambassador to Baghdad, has indicated that the United States government would comply with a [[United Nations]] resolution declaring that coalition forces would have to leave if requested by the Iraqi government. &quot;If that's the wish of the government of Iraq, we will comply with those wishes. But no, we haven't been approached on this issue &amp;mdash; although obviously we stand prepared to engage the future government on any issue concerning our presence here.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;MacAskill, Ewen, Richard Norton-Taylor, and Rory McCarthy, &quot;''[http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1396221,00.html U.S. and UK look for early way out of Iraq]''&quot;. [[The Guardian]], [[January 22]], [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[May 10]], [[2007]], 144 Iraqi Parliamentary lawmakers signed onto a legislative petition calling on the United States to set a timetable for withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,271210,00.html Iraq Bill Demands U.S. Troop Withdraw]Associated Press, ''[[Fox News]]'', [[May 10]], [[2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; On [[June 3]], [[2007]], the Iraqi Parliament voted 85 to 59 to require the Iraqi government to consult with Parliament before requesting additional extensions of the UN Security Council Mandate for Coalition operations in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1180960615762&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull Iraqi parliament wants say in extension of US-led forces] Associated Press, ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', [[June 5]], [[2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; The current UN mandate under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1790]] expires on [[December 31]], [[2008]].

==2003==

{{main|2003 in Iraq}}

===Fall of Saddam Hussein's regime===
On [[May 1]], [[2003]], President Bush declared the &quot;end of major combat operations&quot; in Iraq, while aboard the [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS Abraham Lincoln]] with a large &quot;[[Mission Accomplished]]&quot; banner displayed behind him.

The weeks following the removal of the Saddam Hussein regime were portrayed by American media as generally a euphoric time among the Iraqi populace. [[New York Post]] correspondent [[Jonathan Foreman]], reporting from Baghdad in May 2003, wrote that looting was less widespread than reported, and that &quot;the intensity of the population's pro-American enthusiasm is astonishing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Foreman, Jonathan, &quot;''[http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/002/629xnqei.asp Bad Reporting in Baghdad]''&quot;. News Corporation, Weekly Standard, [[May 12]], [[2003]], Volume 008, Issue 34. (Originally in [[May 12]], [[2002]] issue: You have no idea how well things are going.)&lt;/ref&gt; There were widespread reports of looting, though much of the looting was directed at former government buildings and other remnants of the Saddam Hussein regime. There were reports of looting of Iraq's archaeological treasures, mostly from the [[National Museum of Iraq]]; up to an alleged 170,000 items, worth billions of U.S. dollars:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2942449.stm Looters ransack Baghdad museum] - Thousands of valuable historical items from Baghdad's main museum have been taken or destroyed by looters.

San Francisco Chronicle, [[April 17]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurgency begins===
In the summer of 2003, the U.S. military focused on hunting down the remaining leaders of the former regime, culminating in the killing of Saddam's sons [[Uday Hussein]] and [[Qusay Hussein]] on [[July 22]]. In all, over 200 top leaders of the former regime were killed or captured, as well as numerous lesser functionaries and military personnel. However, even as the Ba'ath party organization disintegrated, elements of the secret police and army began forming guerilla units, since in many cases they had simply gone home rather than openly fight the invading forces. These began to focus their attacks around [[Mosul]], [[Tikrit]] and [[Fallujah]]. In the fall, these units and other elements who called themselves Jihadists began using ambush tactics, suicide bombings, and improvised explosive devices, targeting coalition forces and checkpoints. They favored attacking the unarmored [[Humvee]] vehicles, and in November they successfully attacked U.S. rotary aircraft with [[SA-7]] missiles bought on the global black market. On [[August 19]], the UN Headquarters in [[Baghdad]] was destroyed in the [[Canal Hotel Bombing]], killing at least 22 people, among them [[Sérgio Vieira de Mello]], Special Representative of the [[UN Secretary General]].

===Saddam captured and elections urged===
In December, Saddam himself was [[Saddam Hussein#Capture|captured]]. The provisional government began training a security force intended to defend critical infrastructure, and the U.S. promised over $20 billion in reconstruction aid in the form of credits against Iraq's future oil revenues. At the same time, elements left out of the [[Iraqi Patriotic Alliance]] (IPA) began to agitate for elections. Most prominent among these was [[Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani|Ali al-Sistani]], Grand Ayatollah in the Shia sect of Islam. The United States and its Coalition Provisional Authority opposed allowing democratic elections at this time, preferring instead to eventually hand over power to an unelected group of Iraqis.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Jonathan, &quot;''[http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0119-08.htm Why the US is Running Scared from Elections in Iraq]''&quot;. [[The Guardian]], [[January 19]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt; More insurgents stepped up their activities. The two most turbulent centers were the area around Fallujah and the poor Shia sections of cities from Baghdad to Basra in the south.

==2004==
{{main|2004 in Iraq}}
===Spring uprisings===
In the spring, the United States and the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] decided to confront the rebels with a pair of assaults: one on Fallujah, the center of the &quot;Mohammed's Army of Al-Ansar&quot;, and another on Najaf, home of an important mosque, which had become the focal point for the [[Mahdi Army]] and its activities. In Fallujah four private security contractors, working for [[Blackwater USA]], were ambushed and killed, and their corpses desecrated. In retaliation a U.S. offensive was begun, but it was soon halted because of the protests by the Iraqi Governing Council and negative media coverage. A truce was negotiated that put a former Baathist general in complete charge of the town. The 1st Armored Division along with the 2nd ACR were then shifted south, because Spanish, Salvadoran, Italian, Ukrainian, and Polish forces were having increasing difficulties retaining control over [[Nasiriya]], [[Al Kut]], and [[Najaf]]. The 1st Armored Division and 2nd ACR relieved the Spaniards, Salvadoran, Poles, and Italians, and put down the overt rebellion. At the same time, British forces in Basra were faced with increasing restiveness, and became more selective in the areas they patrolled. In all, April, May and early June represented the bloodiest months of fighting since the end of hostilities. The Iraqi troops who were left in charge of Fallujah after the truce began to disperse and the city fell back under insurgent control. In the April battle for Fallujah, U.S. troops killed about 200 resistance fighters, while 40 Americans died and hundreds were wounded in a fierce battle. U.S. forces then turned their attention to the al Mahdi Army in Najaf.

===Transfer of sovereignty===
In June 2004, under the auspices of [[United Nations Security Council]] [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546|Resolution 1546]] the Coalition transferred limited sovereignty to a caretaker government, whose first act was to begin the trial of [[Saddam Hussein]]. The government began the process of moving towards elections, though the insurgency, and the lack of cohesion within the government itself, led to repeated delays.

Militia leader [[Muqtada al-Sadr]] used his grass-roots organization and Mahdi Militia of over a thousand armed men to take control of the streets of Baghdad. The CPA soon realized it had lost control and closed down his popular newspaper. This resulted in mass anti-American demonstrations. The CPA then attempted to arrest al-Sadr on murder charges. He defied the American military by taking refuge in the Holy City of Najaf. Through the months of July and August, a series of skirmishes in and around Najaf culminated with the Imman Ali Mosque itself under siege, only to have a peace deal brokered by al-Sistani in late August.&lt;ref&gt;Dominick, Brian, &quot;''[http://newstandardnews.net/content/?action=show_item&amp;itemid=858 U.S. Forces Bombard Holy Site After Al-Sadr Offers to Leave]''&quot;. [[The NewStandard]], [[August 20]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Sadr then declared a national cease fire, and opened negotiations with the American and government forces. His militia was incorporated into the Iraqi security forces and al-Sadr is now a special envoy. This incident was the turning point in the failed American efforts to install [[Ahmed Chalabi]] as leader of the interim government. The CPA then put [[Iyad Allawi]] in power, ultimately he was only marginally more popular than the convicted felon Chalabi.

The Allawi government, with significant numbers of holdovers from the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]], began to engage in attempts to secure control of the oil infrastructure, the source of Iraq's foreign currency, and control of the major cities of Iraq. The continuing insurgencies, poor state of the Iraqi Army, disorganized condition of [[Iraqi Police|police]] and security forces, as well as the lack of revenue hampered their efforts to assert control. In addition, both former Baathist elements and militant Shia groups engaged in sabotage, terrorism, open rebellion, and establishing their own security zones in all or part of a dozen cities. The Allawi government vowed to crush resistance, using U.S. troops, but at the same time negotiated with Muqtada al-Sadr.

===Offensives and counteroffensives===
Beginning [[November 8]], American and Iraqi forces invaded the militant stronghold of Fallujah in [[Operation Phantom Fury]], killing and capturing many insurgents. Many rebels were thought to have fled the city before the invasion. U.S.-backed figures put insurgency losses at over 2,000. It was the bloodiest single battle for the U.S. in the war, with 92 Americans dead and several hundred wounded. A video showing the killing of at least one unarmed and wounded man by an American serviceman surfaced, throwing renewed doubt and outrage at the efficiency of the U.S. occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Miklaszewski, Jim, &quot;''[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7738733/Marine cleared in mosque shootings probe; Military concludes3 unarmed insurgents were slain in self-defense]''&quot;. NBC News, [[May 4]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Marine was later cleared of any wrongdoing because the Marines had been warned that the enemy would sometimes feign death and booby-trap bodies as a tactic to lure Marines to their deaths. November was the deadliest month of the occupation for coalition troops, surpassing April.

Another offensive was launched by insurgents during the month of November in [[Mosul]]. U.S. forces backed by peshmerga fighters launched a counteroffensive which resulted in the [[Battle of Mosul (2004)]]. The fighting in Mosul occurred concurrently with the fighting in Fallujah and attributed to the high number of American casualties taken that month.

In December, 14 American soldiers were killed and over a hundred injured when an explosion struck an open-tent mess hall in [[Mosul]], where President Bush had spent Thanksgiving with troops the year before. The explosion is believed to have come from a suicide bomber.

==2005==
{{main|2005 in Iraq}}
===Iraqi elections and aftermath===
{{main|Iraqi legislative election, January 2005}}
On [[January 30]], an [[Iraqi legislative election, 2005|election]] for a government to draft a permanent constitution took place. Although some violence and lack of widespread Sunni Arab participation marred the event, most of the eligible Kurd and Shia populace participated. On [[February 4]], [[Paul Wolfowitz]] announced that 15,000 U.S. troops whose tours of duty had been extended in order to provide election security would be pulled out of Iraq by the next month.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4235787.stm U.S. to pull out 15,000 from Iraq]; The U.S. is to withdraw about 15,000 troops from Iraq fro next month, the deputy defence secretary has announced''&quot;. BBC News, [[February 4]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; February, March and April proved to be relatively peaceful months compared to the carnage of November and January, with insurgent attacks averaging 30 a day from the average 70.

Hopes for a quick end to an insurgency and a withdrawal of U.S. troops were dashed at the advent of May, Iraq's bloodiest month since the invasion of U.S. forces in March and April 2003. Suicide bombers, believed to be mainly disheartened Iraqi Sunni Arabs, Syrians and Saudis, tore through Iraq. Their targets were often Shia gatherings or civilian concentrations mainly of Shias. As a result, over 700 Iraqi civilians died in that month, as well as 79 U.S. soldiers.

During early and mid-May, the U.S. also launched [[Operation Matador]], an assault by around 1,000 Marines in the ungoverned region of western Iraq. Its goal was the closing of suspected insurgent supply routes of volunteers and material from [[Syria]], and with the fight they received their assumption proved correct. Fighters armed with [[flak jacket]]s (unseen in the insurgency by this time) and sporting sophisticated tactics met the Marines, eventually inflicting 30 U.S. casualties by the operation's end, and suffering 125 casualties themselves. The Marines succeeded, recapturing the whole region and even fighting insurgents all the way to the Syrian border, where they were forced to stop (Syrian residents living near the border heard the American bombs very clearly during the operation). The vast majority of these armed and trained insurgents quickly dispersed before the U.S. could bring the full force of its firepower on them, as it did in Fallujah.

===Announcements and renewed fighting===
On [[August 14]], [[2005]] the [[Washington Post]]&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robin, and Ellen Knickmeyer, &quot;''[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/13/AR2005081300853_pf.html U.S. Lowers Sights On What Can Be Achieved in Iraq]; Administration Is Shedding 'Unreality' That Dominated Invasion, Official Says''&quot;. Washington Post, [[August 14]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; quoted one anonymous U.S. senior official expressing that &quot;the United States no longer expects to see a model new democracy, a self-supporting oil industry or a society in which the majority of people are free from serious security or economic challenges... 'What we expected to achieve was never realistic given the timetable or what unfolded on the ground'&quot;. On [[September 22]], [[2005]], Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, said that he had warned the Bush administration in recent days that [[Sectarian violence in Iraq|Iraq was hurtling toward disintegration]], and that the election planned for December was unlikely to make any difference.&lt;ref&gt;MacAskill, Ewen, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1577352,00.html &quot;''Country is hurtling towards disintegration, Saudis warn]''&quot;. Guardian, [[September 24]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; U. S. officials immediately made statements rejecting this view.&lt;ref&gt;Pleming, Sue, &quot;''[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N23652957.htm U.S. rejects Saudi view Iraq near disintegration]''&quot;. Reuters, [[September 23]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional ratification and elections===
{{main|Iraqi constitution ratification vote, 2005|Iraqi legislative election, December 2005}}
The National Assembly elected in January had drafted a new constitution to be ratified in a national referendum on [[October 15]], [[2005]]. For ratification, the constitution required a majority of national vote, and could be blocked by a two thirds &quot;no&quot; vote in each of at least three of the 18 governates. In the actual vote, 79% of the voters voted in favor, and there was a two thirds &quot;no&quot; vote in only two governates, both predominantly Sunni. The new [[Constitution of Iraq]] was ratified and took effect. Sunni turnout was substantially heavier than for the January elections, but insufficient to block ratification.

Elections for a new Iraqi National Assembly were held under the new constitution on [[December 15]], [[2005]]. This election used a proportional system, with approximately 25% of the seats required to be filled by women. After the election, a coalition government was formed under the leadership of Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]], with [[Jalal Talibani]] as president.

==2006==
{{main|2006 in Iraq}}
The beginning of that year was marked by government creation talks and continuous anti-coalition and attacks on mainly Shia civilians.

=== Al-Askari shrine bombing and Sunni-Shia fighting ===
:See ''[[al-Askari Mosque bombing (2006)|Al Askari Mosque bombing]]''

On [[February 22]], [[2006]], at 6:55 a.m. local time (0355 UTC) two bombs were set off by five to seven men dressed as personnel of the Iraqi Special forces who entered the [[Al Askari Mosque]] during the morning. Explosions occurred at the mosque, effectively destroying its golden dome and severely damaging the mosque. Several men, one wearing a military uniform, had earlier entered the mosque, tied up the guards there and set explosives, resulting in the blast.

Shiites across Iraq expressed their anger by destroying Sunni mosques and killing dozens. Religious leaders of both sides called for calm amid fears the situation could erupt into a long-awaited Sunni-Shia ''[[civil war]]'' in Iraq.

On [[March 2]] the director of the Baghdad morgue fled Iraq explaining,
&quot;7,000 people have been killed by death squads in recent months.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,1721366,00.html/|title=Baghdad official who exposed executions flees}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boston Globe reported that around eight times the number of Iraqis killed by terrorist bombings during March 2006 were killed by sectarian death squads during the same period. A total of 1,313 were killed by sectarian militias while 173 were killed by suicide bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/articles/2006/04/02/iraq_militias_wave_of_death/|title=Iraqi militia's wave of death}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[LA Times]] later reported that about 3,800 Iraqis were killed by sectarian violence in Baghdad alone during the first three months of 2006. &lt;!-- Reference no longer available at http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-civilians7may07,0,1349034.story --&gt; During April 2006, morgue numbers show that 1,091 Baghdad residents were killed by sectarian executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4756911.stm/|title=Iraq head urges end to bloodshed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insurgencies, frequent [[terrorism|terrorist attacks]] and [[Sectarian violence in Iraq|sectarian violence]] lead to harsh criticism of US Iraq policy and fears of a failing state and civil war. The concerns were expressed by several US [[think tanks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/fp/saban/analysis/20060215_iraqreport.htm/|title=A Switch in Time: A New Strategy for America in Iraq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=17724&amp;prog=zgp&amp;proj=zme/|title=Back From the Brink: A Strategy for Iraq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/index.cfm?l=1&amp;id=3980/|title=The Next Iraqi War?

In early 2006, a handful of high ranking retired generals begin to demand Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld's resignation due in part to the aforementioned chaos that resulted from his management of the war.

===British hand Muthanna province to Iraqis===
On [[July 12]], [[2006]], Iraq took full control of the [[Al Muthanna Governorate|Muthanna province]], marking the first time since the [[Invasion of Iraq|invasion]] that a province had been handed from foreign troops to the Iraqi government. In a joint statement, the U.S. ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and the U.S. commander in Iraq, General George Casey, hailed it as a milestone in Iraq's capability to govern and protect itself as a &quot;sovereign nation&quot; and said handovers in other provinces will take place as conditions are achieved. &quot;With this first transition of security responsibility, Muthanna demonstrates the progress Iraq is making toward self- governance&quot;, the statement said, adding that &quot;Multi-National Forces will stand ready to provide assistance if needed.&quot; At the ceremony marking the event, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated, &quot;It is a great national day that will be registered in the history of Iraq. This step forward will bring happiness to all Iraqis.&quot;&lt;ref name=happines&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/5175478.stm | title=Iraq province power transferred | author=BBC News | date=[[July 13]], [[2006]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=muthanna&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/07/13/last_chance_for_peace_in_iraq_pm_says/?rss_id=Boston.com+%2F+News | title=Iraq takes over province, clashes in Baghdad | author=Hamid Fadhil | publisher=Reuters | date=[[July 13]], [[2006]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Forward Operating Base Courage handed over to Nineveh province government ===
A former presidential compound of [[Saddam Hussein]], dubbed Forward Operating Base Courage by [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition forces]], was handed over to the [[Ninawa Governorate|Nineveh province government]] on [[July 20]], [[2006]]. The main palace had been home to the 101st Airborne Division Main Command Post, Task Force Olympia CP, and the Task Force Freedom CP. The palace served as the last command post for the Multinational Force-Iraq–Northwest. U.S. soldiers had spent the summer restoring the palace for the eventual handover. Maj. Gen. [[Thomas R. Turner II]], commanding general, Task Force Band of Brothers stated at a ceremony marking the occasion &quot;The turnover of Forward Operating Base Courage is one of the larger efforts towards empowering the Iraqi people and represents an important step in achieving Iraqi self-reliance...The gains made during the past three years demonstrate that the provincial government, the Iraqi Army and the Iraqi Police are increasing their capabilities to take the lead for their nation’s security.&quot; Duraid Mohammed Da’ud Abbodi Kashmoula, the Nineveh province governor, stated after being handed the key to the palace &quot;Now this palace will be used to benefit the Iraqi government and its people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gravelle, Dennis, &quot;''[http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1071&amp;Itemid=41 Iraqi government takes over Mosul base]''&quot;.

=== British troops leave Camp Abu Naji ===
On [[August 24]], [[2006]], Maj. Charlie Burbridge, a British military spokesman, said the last of 1,200 British troops left [[Camp Abu Naji]], just outside [[Amarah]] in Iraq's southern [[Maysan Governorate|Maysan province]]. Burbridge told [[Reuters]] that British troops leaving the base were preparing to head deep into the marshlands along the Iranian border, stating &quot;We are repositioning our forces to focus on border areas and deal with reports of smuggling of weapons and improvised explosive devices from across the border.&quot; 

The base had been a target for frequent mortar and rocket barrages since being set up in 2003, but Burbridge dismissed suggestions the British had been forced out of Amara while acknowledging the attacks had been one reason for the decision to withdraw, the second being that a static base did not fit with the new operation. &quot;Abu Naji was a bulls-eye in the middle of a dartboard. The attacks were a nuisance and were a contributing factor in our planning&quot;, to quit the base, he said, adding &quot;By no longer presenting a static target, we reduce the ability of the militias to strike us..We understand the militias in Maysan province are using this as an example that we have been pushed out of Abu Naji, but that is not true. It was very rare for us to take casualties.&quot; Burbridge stated that Iraqi security forces would now be responsible for day-to-day security in Maysan but stressed that the British had not yet handed over complete control to them. 

[[Muqtada al-Sadr]] called the departure the first expulsion of U.S.-led coalition forces from an Iraqi urban center. A message from al-Sadr's office that played on car-mounted speakers throughout Amarah exclaimed &quot;This is the first Iraqi city that has kicked out the occupier...We have to celebrate this occasion!&quot; A crowd of as many as 5,000 people, including hundreds armed with AK-47 assault rifles, ransacked Camp Abu Naji immediately after the last British soldier had departed despite the presence of a 450-member Iraqi army brigade meant to guard the base.
The looting, which lasted from about 10 a.m. to early evening, turned violent at about noon when individuals in the mob shot at the base. The Iraqi troops asked the province's governor for permission to return fire, a decision the British military highlighted as evidence of the security force's training. &quot;It demonstrated that they understand the importance of civilian primacy, that the government -- and not the military -- is in charge&quot;, Burbridge said in a phone interview with the [[Washington Post]]. Injuries were reported on both sides, but no one was killed. Burbridge attributed the looting to economic factors rather than malice, stating &quot;The people of Amarah -- many of whom are extremely poor -- saw what they believed to be a bit of an Aladdin's cave inside.&quot; Residents of Amarah, however, told the Post that antipathy toward the British was strong. &quot;The looters stole everything -- even the bricks...They almost leveled the whole base to the ground&quot;, said Ahmed Mohammed Abdul Latief, 20, a student at Maysan University.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Amit R., &quot;''[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/24/AR2006082401917.html?nav=rss_nation/special British Leave Iraqi Base; Militia Supporters Jubilant]''&quot;.

Washington Post, [[August 26]], [[2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Situation in and around Baghdad ===
A US general says on [[August 28]], [[2006]] violence has fallen in [[Baghdad]] by nearly a half since July, although he acknowledged a spike in bombings in the past 48 hours. &quot;Insurgents and terrorists are hitting back in an attempt to offset the success of the Iraqi government and its security forces&quot;, Maj Gen William Caldwell told reporters. After meeting Iraqi Defence Minister [[Qadir Obeidi|Abdul-Qader Mohammed Jassim al-Mifarji]], UK Defence Minister [[Des Browne]] said Iraq was moving forward. &quot;Each time I come, I see more progress&quot;, he said.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/5293278.stm Fierce battles in south Iraq city]&quot;. BBC- News, [[August 28]], [[2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States|American]] military command acknowledged in the week of [[October 16]], [[2006]] that it was considering an overhaul of its latest security plan for Baghdad, where three months of intensive American-led sweeps had failed to curb violence by [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Arab-led insurgents and [[Shi'a Islam|Shiite]] and Sunni militias.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/20/world/middleeast/21iraqcnd.html?ex=1318996800&amp;en=a542d37a1dff56f9&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss Attack on Iraqi City Shows Militia’s Power] - New York Times, [[October 20]], [[2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous car and roadside bombs rocked the capital [[November 9]], [[2006]] morning: In the Karrada district, a car bomb killed six and wounded 28 others. Another car bomb killed seven and wounded another 27 in the northern Qahira neighborhood. In South Baghdad, a mortar then a suicide car bomber killed seven and wounded 27 others near the Mishin bazaar. Near the college of Fine Arts in north-central Baghdad, a car bomb targeting an Iraqi patrol killed three and wounded six others. Two policemen were injured when they tried to dismantle a car bomb in the Zayouna district. A car bomb on Palestine Street in northeastern Baghdad meant for an Iraqi patrol killed one soldier but also wounded four civilians. Yet another car bomb in southern Baghdad wounded three people. And another car bomb near a passport services building in a northern neighborhood killed 2 people and wounded 7 others.

A roadside bomb in central Baghdad killed two and wounded 26 others. A police patrol was blasted by a roadside bomb near a petrol station; four were killed in the explosion. Another four people were wounded in the New Baghdad neighborhood by yet another roadside bomb. A bomb hidden in a sack exploded in Tayern square killing three and wounding 19. Another bomb in the Doura neighborhood killed one and wounded three. Mortars fell in Kadmiyah killing one woman and injuring eight people, and in Bayaladat where four were wounded.

Also in the capital, a group of laborers were kidnapped [[November 9]], [[2006]] morning; five bodies were recovered later in the Doura neighborhood, but at least one other body was found in Baghdad [[November 9]], [[2006]]. Gunmen killed a police colonel and his driver in eastern Baghdad. And just outside of town, police arrested two people in a raid and discovered one corpse.&lt;ref name=&quot;antiwar1&quot;&gt;[http://www.antiwar.com/updates/?articleid=9986/ Thursday: 81 Iraqis Killed, 183 Injured] at antiwar.com, [[November 9]], [[2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[November 10]], [[2006]], Iraqi police recovered 18 bullet-riddled bodies in various neighborhoods around the capital. Police were unable to identify the bodies.

[[November 11]], [[2006]], two bombs planted in an outdoor market in central Baghdad exploded around noon, killing six and wounded 32 people. A car bomb and a roadside bomb were detonated five minutes apart in the market, which is in an area close to Baghdad's main commercial center. The U.S. military said it has put up a $50,000 reward for anyone who helps find an American soldier kidnapped in Baghdad. The 42-year-old Army Reserve specialist, Ahmed K. Altaie, was abducted on [[October 23]] when he left the [[Green Zone]], the heavily fortified section where the [[United States]] maintains its headquarters, to visit his Iraqi wife and family.

A suicide bomber killed 25 Iraqis and wounded 45 [[November 12]], [[2006]] morning outside the national police headquarters' recruitment center in western Baghdad, an emergency police official said. They were among dozens of men waiting to join the police force in the Qadessiya district when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives belt. In central Baghdad, a car bomb and roadside bomb killed four Iraqi civilians and wounded 10 near the Interior Ministry complex. And in the Karrada district of central Baghdad, one Iraqi was killed and five were wounded when a car bomb exploded near an outdoor market [[November 12]], [[2006]] morning. Gunmen shot dead an Iraqi officer with the new Iraqi intelligence system as he was walking towards his parked car in the southwestern Baghdad neighborhood of Bayaa. Two civilians were killed and four more were wounded when a roadside bomb hit a car in the eastern Baghdad neighborhood of Zayuna.&lt;ref name=cnn121106&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/11/12/iraq.main/index.html Suicide bomber attacks police recruitment center] [[CNN]], [[November 12]], [[2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Latifiya]]: Gunmen killed a truck driver and kidnapped 11 Iraqis after stopping four vehicles at a fake checkpoint south of the capital. At the fake checkpoint in Latifiya, about {{convert|25|mi|km}} south of Baghdad, gunmen took the four vehicles -- three minibuses and a truck -- along with the kidnapped Iraqis. The Iraqis -- 11 men and three women -- were driving from [[Al Diwaniyah|Diwaniya]] to [[Baghdad]] for shopping when they were stopped. The gunmen left the three women and kidnapped the 11 men, the official said.
*[[Baqubah]]: North of the capital near Baquba, a suicide car bomb explosion killed two people at the main gate of a police station in Zaghanya town.

===Al-Qaeda===
Saddam Hussein was accused of hiding Al-Qaeda members in Iraq, that was one of the justifications for the war with Iraq, however that claim had no merits since only few Al-Qaeda members were found hiding in Iraq before the invasion, all were of lower standings. Saddam was not a fundamentalist, he was a secular leader, something terrorist groups do not approve of a Muslim leader.

On [[September 3]], [[2006]], Iraq says it has arrested the country's second most senior figure in [[Al-Qaeda]], &quot;severely wounding&quot; an organization the US military says is spreading sectarian violence that could bring civil war. The National Security Adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie summoned reporters to a hastily arranged news conference to announce that al Qaeda leader Hamid Juma Faris al-Suaidi had been seized some days ago. Hitherto little heard of, and also known as Abu Humam or Abu Rana, Suaidi was captured hiding in a building with a group of followers. &quot;Al-Qaeda in Iraq is severely wounded&quot;, Rubaie said. He said Suaidi had been involved in ordering the bombing of the Shi'ite shrine in Samarra in February 2006 that unleashed the wave of tit-for-tat killings now threatening civil war. Iraqi officials blame Al-Qaeda for the attack. The group denies it. Rubaie did not give Suaidi's nationality. He said he had been tracked to the same area north of Baghdad where US forces killed Al-Qaeda's leader [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] in June 2006. &quot;He was hiding in a building used by families. He wanted to use children and women as human shields&quot;, Rubaie said. Little is publicly known about Suaidi. Rubaie called him the deputy of [[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]], a shadowy figure, probably [[Egypt]]ian, who took over the Sunni Islamist group from Zarqawi.&lt;ref name=tvnz&gt;&quot;''[http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411416/825598 Iraq captures Al-Qaeda deputy]''&quot;. One- News, [[September 4]], [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The US military says Al-Qaeda is a &quot;prime instigator&quot; of the violence between Iraq's [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] minority and [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'ite]] majority but that U.S. and Iraqi operations have &quot;severely disrupted&quot; it.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;&quot;''[http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411416/825598 Iraq captures al Qaeda deputy]''&quot;.

===Security handover to Iraq's army===
A Zogby poll in February 2006 determined that a majority of U.S. troops serving in Iraq think that the U.S. should exit the country within a year, i.e. before February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=1075/|title=U.S. Troops in Iraq: 72% Say End War in 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poll found:
* &quot;An overwhelming majority of 72% of American troops serving in Iraq think the U.S. should exit the country within the next year, and nearly one in four say the troops should leave immediately&quot;
* &quot;89% of reserves and 82% of those in the National Guard said the U.S. should leave Iraq within a year, 58% of Marines think so.&quot;

Washington claims to be eager for Iraq's army to take over security and pave the way for a withdrawal of its 140,000 troops. But a handover ceremony on [[September 2]], [[2006]] was postponed at the last minute, first to [[September 3]], [[2006]] , then indefinitely, after a dispute emerged between the government and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] over the wording of a document outlining their armies' new working relationship. &quot;There are some disputes&quot;, an Iraqi government source said. &quot;We want thorough control and the freedom to make decisions independently.&quot; US spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Barry Johnson played down any arguments and expected a signing soon: &quot;It is embarrassing but it was decided it was better not to sign the document.&quot; Practically, US troops remain the dominant force. Their tanks entered the southern, Shi'ite city of [[Diwaniya]] on [[September 3]], [[2006]] . The show of force came a week after Shi'ite militiamen killed 20 Iraqi troops in a battle that highlighted violent power struggles between rival Shi'ite factions in the oil-rich south.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

===Abu Ghraib===
On [[September 2]], [[2006]], the [[Abu Ghraib prison]] was formally handed over to Iraq's government. The formal transfer was conducted between Major General Jack Gardner, Commander of Task Force 134, and representatives of the Iraqi Ministry of Justice and the Iraqi army.&lt;ref name=transfer&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2006/09/03/inmates_transferred_out_of_abu_ghraib_as_coalition_hands_off_control/ | title=Inmates transferred out of Abu Ghraib as coalition hands off control | author=Associated Press | date=[[September 3]], [[2006]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraqi government takes control of the 8th Iraqi Army Division===
On [[September 7]], [[2006]], Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki signed a document taking control of Iraq's small naval and air forces and the 8th Iraqi Army Division, based in the south. At a ceremony marking the occasion, Gen. George Casey, the top U.S. commander in Iraq stated &quot;From today forward, the Iraqi military responsibilities will be increasingly conceived and led by Iraqis.&quot; Previously, the U.S.-led Multinational Forces in Iraq, commanded by Casey, gave orders to the Iraqi armed forces through a joint American-Iraqi headquarters and chain of command. Senior U.S. and coalition officers controlled army divisions but smaller units were commanded by Iraqi officers. After the handover, the chain of command flows directly from the prime minister in his role as Iraqi commander in chief, through his Defense Ministry to an Iraqi military headquarters. From there, the orders go to Iraqi units on the ground. The other nine Iraqi division remain under U.S. command, with authority gradually being transeferred. U.S. military officials said there was no specific timetable for the transition. U.S. military spokesman Maj. Gen. William Caldwell said it would be up to al-Maliki to decide &quot;how rapidly he wants to move along with assuming control...They can move as rapidly thereafter as they want. I know, conceptually, they've talked about perhaps two divisions a month.&quot; The 8th Division's commander, Brig. Gen. Othman al-Farhoud, told The Associated Press his forces still needed support from the U.S.-led coalition for things such as medical assistance, storage facilities and air support, stating &quot;In my opinion, it will take time [[before his division was completely self-sufficient.]]&quot;&lt;ref name=milhandover&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2006-09-07-iraq-military_x.htm?csp=34 | title=Iraq assumes command of military today | author=Associated Press | date=[[September 7]], [[2006]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anbar province reported as politically &quot;lost&quot; to U. S. and Iraqi government===
On [[September 11]], [[2006]], it transpired that Colonel Peter Devlin, chief of intelligence for the Marine Corps in Iraq, had filed a secret report, described by those who have seen it as saying that the U.S. and the Iraqi government have been defeated politically in [[Al Anbar Governorate|Anbar province]]. According to ''The Washington Post,'' an unnamed Defense Department source described Devlin as saying &quot;there are no functioning Iraqi government institutions in Anbar, leaving a vacuum that has been filled by the insurgent group al-Qaeda in Iraq, which has become the province's most significant political force.&quot; The Post said that Devlin is a very experienced intelligence officer whose report was being taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Washington Post|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/10/AR2006091001204.html|date=2006-09-11|accessdate=2006-09-12|title=Situation Called Dire in West Iraq; Anbar Is Lost Politically, Marine Analyst Says. (Page A01) |author=Thomas E. Ricks; page A01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, Major General Richard Zilmer, commander of the Marines in Iraq, stated: &quot;We are winning this war... I have never heard any discussion about the war being lost before this weekend.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Reuters|author=Peter Graff|title=Marines deny losing Iraq's biggest province|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/12/AR2006091201188.html|date=2006-09-12|accessdate=2006-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq takes over security responsibility in southern Dhi Qar province===
On [[September 21]], [[2006]], [[Italy|Italian]] troops handed security control of the [[Dhi Qar]] province to Iraqi forces, making Dhi Qar the second of the country's 18 provinces to come under complete local control. At a ceremony in [[Nasiriyah]] marking the handover, Italian Defense Minister [[Arturo Parisi]] told Iraqi Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]] &quot;The Italian contingent is going back. The mission is accomplished - the security of the province is in your hands.&quot; Italy has about 1,600 troops in the country, mostly in Nasiriyah, and that force is expected to be withdrawn by year’s end. Dhi Qar is populated mainly by [[Shi'a Islam|Shiite Muslims]] and has not experienced the [[Sectarian violence in Iraq|sectarian violence]] that has plagued other provinces of Iraq.&lt;ref name=dhiqar&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bostonherald.com/international/view.bg?articleid=158592 | title= Iraq takes over security responsibility for southern Dhi Qar province from Italian troops | publisher=Associated Press | date=[[September 21]], [[2006]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq takes over security responsibilities in Najaf province===
On [[December 20]], [[2006]], U.S. forces handed over control of the southern province of [[Najaf Governorate|Najaf]] to [[Iraqi security forces]]. Najaf is the third Iraqi province to be turned over to Iraqi forces, but the first such handover by U.S. troops. U.S. forces will remain on standby in case the security situation deteriorates. &quot;If we don't handle the responsibility, history will destroy us&quot;, Iraq's national security adviser, Mouwafak al-Rubaie, said at a ceremony in a stadium in [[Najaf]] city, the provincial capital. &quot;Transferring responsibility is an indication of the increased capacity of the Iraqi police and the Iraqi army&quot;, Maj. Gen. Kurt Cichowski said at the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2006-12-20-najaf-handover_x.htm?csp=34 | title=U.S. transfers security of Najaf province to Iraqis | publisher=Associated Press | date=2006-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/20/AR2006122000099.html | title=U.S. Transfers Control Of Najaf Province to Iraqi Security Forces | publisher=Washington Post | author=Nancy Trejos and Saad Sarhan | date=[[December 21]], [[2006]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see details|Multinational force in Iraq}}

As of September, 2006, there were 21 countries with military forces stationed in Iraq. These were Albania, Armenia, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, South Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, United Kingdom, and the United States. Fiji is also present but under the United Nations banner.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;&quot;''[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/iraq_orbat_coalition.htm Iraq Coalition Troops; Non-U.S. Forces in Iraq]''&quot;.

Well over 80% of the forces occupying Iraq are American. As of September 2006, there were an estimated 145,000 U.S. troops in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/iraq_orbat.htm U.S. Forces Order of Battle]''&quot;. Global Security, [[March 4]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; The next largest contingent is that of the [[United Kingdom]], with just under 9,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt; There are also approximately 20,000 private security contractors of different nationalities under various employers.

==Iraqi councils and authorities==
On [[October 11]], [[2002]], President Bush's senior adviser on the Middle East, Zalmay Khalilzad, released U.S. government plans to establish an American-led military administration in Iraq, as in post-war Germany and Japan, which could last for several years after the fall of Saddam.&lt;ref&gt;Borger, Julian, &quot;''[http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,810609,00.html U.S. plans military rule and occupation of Iraq]; Saddam would be replaced by General Tommy Franks''&quot;. The Guardian, [[October 12]], [[2002]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the run-up to the invasion, the U.S. promised a speedy transition to a democratic government, as well as the creation of an Iraqi constitution, and the active role of Iraqis in the establishment of an interim authority and new government. U.S. officials continue to emphasize that the invasion was not about long-term occupation, but about liberation.

In November 2003, [[Paul Bremer]] announced the plan to hand over limited sovereignty to the Iraqi governing council by [[June 30]], [[2004]]. A draft constitution was written and approved by the [[Iraqi Governing Council]] in March 2004. The United States has stated its plans to enter into what it calls a security agreement with the new Iraqi government and maintain military authority until a new Iraqi army is established. The Bush administration remained committed to this date despite the unstable security situation. The interim Iraqi government was named in May 2004, at which point the [[Iraqi Governing Council]] was dissolved, though there was heavy overlap between the two governing bodies.

The U.S.-led [[Coalition Provisional Authority]], for administrative purposes, divided Iraq into four security zones (see map): a North zone in the [[Mosul]] - [[Kirkuk]] region, a Central zone in the [[Baghdad]] - [[Tikrit]] region, a Southern Central zone in the [[Karbala]] region and a South zone in the [[Basra]] region. The northern and central zones are garrisoned by U.S. troops, while the Southern Central zone is a garrisoned by a [[Multi-National Division (South Central)|Multi-National Division]] under Polish command and the South zone is garrisoned by a [[Multi-National Division (South East)|Multi-National Division]] under British command.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/39560000/gif/_39560495_iraq_troops6_416map.gif Map of Iraq and Caolition forces]. BBC News (GIF format).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early months of the occupation, looting and vandalism slowed the restoration of basic services such as water, electricity, and [[sanitation]]. By Spring 2004, these services were mostly restored to pre-war levels. Ongoing work is continuing to provide sufficient sanitation. Uneven power distribution remained a problem through 2004, with the Baghdad area continuing to have periodic blackouts.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''IRAQ:[http://www.cidi.org/humanitarian/hsr/iraq/ixl49.html Electricity almost back to pre-war levels]''&quot;. United Nations, [[March 2]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt; On [[July 28]], [[2005]], Iraq's Electricity Minister announced that Iraq's electricity supply had risen to above pre-war levels.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://www.iraqdirectory.com/files/articles/article623.htm Iraq electricity surpasses pre-war levels]''&quot;. Iraq Directory, [[July 28]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations of [[Human rights situation in post-Saddam Iraq|human rights violations by the occupying forces]] have been embarrassing to the Bush administration and the British government. Some of the allegations have been investigated. Several U.S. and British officers have been charged with the abuse of prisoners, and as of the beginning of February 2005, seven American soldiers have been convicted in connection with abuse at the [[Abu Ghraib prison]]. &lt;!-- I will write an update regarding the British court martials. --&gt;

Former [[Ba'ath Party]] members and military officers who have no criminal past or human rights abuses have been allowed to return to government positions.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robin, and Walter Pincus, &quot;''[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37921-2004Apr23.html U.S., U.N.

===Reconstruction===
{{main|Reconstruction of Iraq}}

For the reconstruction, contracts were awarded to private companies. Initially companies from countries that had opposed the war were excluded from these contracts, but this decision was reversed due to protests.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20031209.wpent1209/BNStory/National/ Canada barred from Iraq contracts]''&quot;. Associated Press, [[December 9]], [[2003]].&lt;/ref&gt; Political activists and commentators allege that [[The Pentagon]] favoured companies like [[Halliburton]], former employer of Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], because they had connections to high-ranking members of the Bush administration.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4508115/ Halliburton won deal after auditor warns Pentagon saw 'systemic' problems with contracts]''&quot;.

CNN, [[September 25]], [[2003]].&lt;/ref&gt; This suspicion had already been a concern during the [[Protests against the 2003 Iraq war|global protests against the war on Iraq]]. An audit found that Halliburton subsidiary [[Kellogg, Brown and Root]] (KBR) may have overcharged the U.S. government $&amp;nbsp;61&amp;nbsp;million, on contracts worth billions, for bringing oil products for the U.S. army into Iraq via a [[Kuwait]]i subcontractor, Altanmia Commercial Marketing Co.&lt;ref&gt;Jehl, Douglas, &quot;''[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/11/international/middleeast/11CND-PENT.html?ex=1083211200&amp;en=a495a8aabe8e9000&amp;ei=5070 Pentagon Finds Halliburton Overcharged on Iraq Contracts]''&quot;. NY Times, [[December 11]], [[2003]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some also argue that foreign contractors are doing work which could be done by unemployed Iraqis, which might be a factor fueling resentment of the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, Matt, &quot;''[http://www.casperstartribune.net/articles/2004/04/27/news/world/421458792344630787256e830003f3bd.txt Bid rigging, fraud and damage common in Iraq]''&quot;.

BBC News, [[January 30]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[August 14]], [[2005]], a Washington Post story&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robin, and Ellen Knickmeyer, &quot;''[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/13/AR2005081300853_pf.html U.S. Lowers Sights On What Can Be Achieved in Iraq]; Administration Is Shedding 'Unreality' That Dominated Invasion, Official Says''&quot;. Washington Post, [[August 14]], [[2005]]; A01.&lt;/ref&gt; on the administration's effort to lower expectations, quoted Wayne White, former head of the State Department's Iraq intelligence team, as saying &quot;The most thoroughly dashed expectation was the ability to build a robust self-sustaining economy. We're nowhere near that. State industries, electricity are all below what they were before we got there.&quot;

A report of the United States Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction found widespread &quot;fraud, incompetence and confusion&quot; in the American occupation's handling of billions of dollars of Iraqi government money and American funds given for reconstruction (NY&amp;nbsp;Times [[January 25]], [[2006]] &lt;!-- Reference at http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/25/international/middleeast/25reconstruct.html?hp&amp;ex=1138251600&amp;en=0138ddaecd4566f6&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage requires log-in --&gt;). Inspector-general [[Stuart Bowen, Jr.]] noted that only 49 of 136 planned water- and sanitation-related projects will be completed. &lt;!-- Reference unavailable at http://today.reuters.com/investing/financeArticle.aspx?type=bondsNews&amp;storyID=URI:urn:newsml:reuters.com:20060127:MTFH70618_2006-01-27_00-21-24_N26152510:1 --&gt;

In April 2007, the New York Times reported that U. S. federal oversight inspectors found that &quot;in a sampling of eight projects that the United States had declared successes, seven were no longer operating as designed because of plumbing and electrical failures, lack of proper maintenance, apparent looting, and expensive equipment that lay idle. The United States has sometimes admitted&amp;nbsp;... that some of its reconstruction projects have been abandoned, delayed, or poorly constructed. But this is the first time inspectors have found that projects officially declared as successes&amp;mdash;in some cases, as little as six months before the latest inspections&amp;mdash;were no longer working properly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Glanz, James (2007), &quot;Inspectors Find Rebuilt Projects Crumbing in Iraq; Quick Deterioration Seen; Iraqis Share the Blame at Sites Where the U. S. Declared Success.&quot; ''The New York Times,'' April 29, 2007, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civilian government==
{{see details|Politics of Iraq}}

The establishment of a new civilian government of Iraq was complicated by religious and political divisions between the majority [[Shi'ite]] population and the formerly ruling [[Sunni]] Arabs. Moreover, many of the people in Saddam's ruling [[Ba'ath Party]] were perceived as tainted by the association by some parties. In northern Iraq, [[Kurd]]s had already had effectively autonomous rule for 12 years under the protection of the no-fly zone.

On [[May 16]], [[2003]], U.S. officials abandoned the plan to cede authority to a democratically chosen interim civilian Iraqi government (similar to what had happened in [[Afghanistan]] following the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]]) and presented a resolution to the UN to give the United States and the United Kingdom broad power and to lift economic sanctions on Iraq, allowing the occupying countries authority to use oil resources to pay for rebuilding the country. Passage of the resolution allowed them to appoint an interim government by themselves.

On [[July 13]], [[2003]], an Iraqi Governing Council was appointed by Coalition Provisional Authority Administrator [[L. Paul Bremer]].
[[Image:Iraqcouncil.jpg|framed|The Iraq Interim Governing Council.]]

===United Nations resolutions===
On [[May 22]], [[2003]], the [[UN Security Council]] voted 14&amp;ndash;0 to give the United States and Britain the power to govern Iraq and use its oil resources to rebuild the country. [[UN Security Council Resolution 1483|Resolution 1483]] removed nearly 13 years of economic sanctions originally imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The resolution allows UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] to appoint a special representative to work with U.S. and British administrators on reconstruction, humanitarian aid, and the creation of a new government.

The resolution also created the [[Development Fund for Iraq]], which collected funds from oil sales. The fund was initially run by the United States and Britain to rebuild the country, and is overseen by a new advisory body composed of the United Nations and international financial institutions. In June 2004, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that American authorities spent $2.5 billion from Iraqi oil revenue despite agreements that the oil revenues should be set aside for use after the restoration of Iraq's sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman, Steven R., &quot;''[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/21/politics/21DIPL.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position= U.S. Is Quietly Spending $2.5 Billion From Iraqi Oil Revenue to Pay for Iraqi Projects]''&quot;. NY Times (Foreign Desk), [[June 21]], [[2004]]. (Late Edition - Final, Section A, Page 8 , Column 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[August 14]], [[2003]], the Security Council voted 14&amp;ndash;0 to &quot;welcome&quot; the creation of the Iraqi Governing Council. [[UN Security Council Resolution 1500|Resolution 1500]] stopped short of formally recognizing the governing council as Iraq's legitimate governing body but called it an &quot;important step&quot; towards creating a sovereign government.

===Elections===
For several months the United States maintained that it intended to convene a constitutional convention, composed of influential Iraqis. However, European demands for an early election and [[Ayatollah]] [[Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani|Ali al-Sistani's]] insistence eventually forced the United States to let the appointed Governing Council serve this function.

In the early months of the occupation, new officials were appointed to several local and regional positions (e.g., mayors, governors, local councils). The officials were chosen from a select group of individuals (including ex-Ba'ath party officials) in an attempt to speed the return to normality and to avoid the election of people opposed to the American and British presence. Certain religious clerics and other officials were considered to be overly radical or dangerous. On occasion the appointed officials were found to behave less than admirably. On [[June 30]], [[2003]], the appointed mayor of Najaf was arrested on charges of corruption.

By February 2004, democratic elections, under the supervision of the CPA, had already been held at the municipal and city level in some of the southern and northern provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Shadid, Anthony, &quot;''[http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A44553-2004Feb15 In Iraqi Towns, Electoral Experiment Finds Some Success]''&quot;. Washington Post, [[February 16]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[November 15]], the Iraqi Governing Council announced that a transitional government would take over in June from the U.S.-led powers, and that an elected government would follow by the end of 2005 once a constitution had been drafted and ratified. The transitional government would be selected in June 2004 by a transitional council formed in May 2004.

The Governing Council revealed the timetable after the United States government, in reaction to terrorist and [[militant]] activity against occupying troops and aid organisations, abandoned its earlier plan that a sovereign government would take charge only after creating a constitution and elections held. [[Jalal Talabani]], who was chairman of the council, said the transition would involve &quot;''the creation of a permanent constitution by an elected council, directly elected by the people, and also the election of a new government according to the articles of this new constitution before the end of 2005.''&quot;

In March 2004, an interim constitution was created, called the [[Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period]]. The document called for the creation of an elected [[National Assembly]] to take place no later than January 2005. The question of the election calendar became a matter of importance for Iraq and the U.S.: while a quick election would legitimise the Iraqi government and shed a favourable light on the U.S.-led occupation of the country, the prospect of violence delayed it. It was finally set for [[January 30]], [[2005]]. Though then-President [[Ghazi Al-Yaouar]] asked the United Nations to reconsider the electoral schedule several weeks before the election, the [[Iraqi legislative election, January 2005|legislative election]] was held on time, creating the [[Iraqi National Assembly]].

The elected assembly drafted a new [[Constitution of Iraq|constitution for Iraq]], submitting it to the Iraqi people for review on [[August 28]]. On [[October 15]], Iraqis [[Iraqi constitution ratification vote, 2005|voted to approve the new constitution]]. On [[December 15]], the first [[Iraqi legislative election, December 2005|legislative election]] under the new constitution was held.

===Sovereignty for Iraq===
[[Image:Iraq-sovereign.jpg|thumb|250px|U.S. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice gives confirmation of Iraqi sovereignty to U.S. President George W. Bush, who then wrote, “Let Freedom Reign!,” during the opening session of the NATO Summit in Istanbul, Turkey, on Monday, [[June 28]], [[2004]].]]
{{see details|Iraqi sovereignty}}
{{see details|Politics of Iraq}}

In a [[June 1]], [[2004]], press conference, President Bush said that he was working with various world leaders to create a [[U.N. Security Council]] resolution endorsing the transition from the U.S.-dominated occupation to complete autonomy for Iraq. Under this resolution, Coalition forces would remain in Iraq until the new government could establish security and stabilization: &quot;There is a deep desire by the Iraqis — don't get me wrong — to run their own affairs and to be in a position where they can handle their own security measures.&quot; On [[June 8]], Security Council resolution 1546 was adopted unanimously, calling for &quot;the end of the occupation and the assumption of full responsibility and authority by a fully sovereign and independent Interim Government of Iraq by [[June 30]], [[2004]].&quot;

On [[June 28]], [[2004]], the occupation was nominally ended by the CPA, which transferred limited power to a new Iraqi government led by Prime Minister Iyad Allawi. The [[multinational force (Iraq)|multinational]] [[military alliance]] continued to assist the Allawi government in governing the Iraqis. The purpose of the Occupation of Iraq was, according to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]], purely to bring about a transition from post-war anarchy to full Iraqi sovereignty.

A further milestone in sovereignty was achieved with the creation of a democratically-elected administration on [[April 6]], [[2005]] including Prime Minister [[Ibrahim al-Jaafari]] and President [[Jalal Talabani]] following the [[Iraqi legislative election, 2005|Iraqi elections]] of January 2005.

Under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1790]], the mandate of the [[multinational force in Iraq]] was extended until [[December 31]], [[2008]], after which there is no justification for foreign militaries to remain in the country.  On [[June 6]], [[2008]], the ''Independent'' reported that the United States was applying pressure to the government of Iraq to sign a “strategic alliance” (not a “treaty”, which would require approval of the US senate), giving US forces broad freedom in continuing to operate in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Cockburn: “[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/us-issues-threat-to-iraqs-50bn-foreign-reserves-in-military-deal-841407.html?service=Print US issues threat to Iraq’s $50bn foreign reserves in military deal]”, ''[[The Independent]]'', [[June 6]], [[2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraqi insurgency==
{{see details|Iraqi insurgency}}

Despite the defeat of the old Iraqi army, [[Irregular military|irregular forces]], both [[Iraq]]i and external, have conducted attacks against the Coalition and, more recently, the new Iraqi government. In the early months following the &quot;end of major combat operations&quot;, insurgents conducted sniper attacks, suicide bombings at road checkpoints, and ambushes, resulting in about 112 multinational force personnel deaths per month.

Sometimes the attackers would say that they were motivated by revenge (e.g., an anti-coalition group claimed the four Iraqis that were allegedly shot at by British soldiers during a demonstration were unarmed and acting peacefully; six British soldiers were later killed by Iraqis). Several Iraqis, reportedly unarmed, were shot in anti-Alliance demonstrations, mostly in the nation's Sunni Arab areas. While Shi'a Muslim areas were mostly peaceful, Ayatollah [[Sayed Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim]], who returned to Iraq after decades in exile shortly after the occupation began, said: &quot;We are not afraid of the British or American troops. This country wants to keep its sovereignty and the forces of the coalition must leave it.&quot; Coalition forces denied the accusations of targeting unarmed civilians. They said they were fired upon and were returning fire.

The violent insurgency began shortly after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 Invasion of Iraq]] and increased during the [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003-2005|occupation]]. Originally, the insurgents targeted the coalition force (a majority of whom are from the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]]) and the interim government (eg., the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]]) formed under the occupation. The insurgency grew during the period between the invasion of Iraq and the establishment of a new Iraqi government.

===Guerrilla war===
In late June, 2003 there was some public debate in the U.S. as to whether the insurgency could be characterized as a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]]. On [[June 17]], Army [[John Abizaid|Gen. John P. Abizaid]] said that forces in Iraq were &quot;conducting what I would describe as a classical guerrilla-type campaign against us. It's low-intensity conflict in our doctrinal terms, but it's war however you describe it.&quot; In a statement to Congress on [[June 18]], Deputy Defense Secretary [[Paul Wolfowitz]] said &quot;There's a guerrilla war there but we can win it.&quot;

===Sabotage===
:''For more details on this topic, see [[Iraqi insurgency#Sabotage|Iraqi insurgency's sabotage]].''

Sabotage of [[Crude oil|oil]] [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and refineries have been a key tactic of the [[Iraqi insurgency]]. The United States had intended to quickly rebuild Iraqi infrastructure for production back to pre-war levels, but widespread sabotage slowed down the pace of reconstruction. The administration has set an oil-production goal of 5 million barrels per day, but the president's numbers show that production decreased slightly in 2005 over 2004 from 2.2 million gallons per day to 2.1 million gallons per day. The administration claims that oil production, however, is up from 2003, when oil was produced at 1.58 million barrels per day.

Iraqi analysts have argued that the administration's measures are misleading because the war began in 2003, which pushed production numbers lower than they normally would have been.

&quot;They are way off of their original projections&quot; for where oil production would be now, said Rick Barton, an expert on Iraqi reconstruction at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. &quot;It's basically gone nowhere in the entire time we've been there. Of course, they haven't been able to protect the pipelines. You just can't be rebuilding a country during an active war.&quot;{{Fact|date=February 2007}}&lt;!-- Is this source for the graf? Could that be indicated somehow? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Greg, &quot;''[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,177982,00.html Dems Doubt Iraq Progress]''&quot;. Fox News, [[December 7]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fallujah===
{{see details|Fallujah}}

The Fallujah offensive [[Operation Vigilant Resolve]] was launched on [[April 5]] in response to the [[March 31]] murder and mutilation of four of Blackwater's employees. Roads leading into and out of the city were closed. When the U.S. Soldiers and Marines tried to enter, fierce fighting erupted. Members of the Iraqi insurgency opened fire with heavy machine guns, rockets, and rocket-propelled grenades. The Soldiers and Marines answered by bringing in tanks and helicopters.

The ensuing firefight resulted in a large number of casualties. Dozens of Marines were killed and injured. Two hundred and seventy-one members of the non-coalition forces were killed and 793 injured, according to official counts for the period of [[April 5]] through [[April 22]]. Conflicting reports leave it unclear how many of the dead and injured were rebel fighters or women and children.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Iraq: U.S. Marines Fight Insurgents in Fallujah''&quot;. The Las Vegas Sun, [[April 7]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/12/1081621869099.html 600 Iraqis killed in Falluja in one week]''&quot;. [[April 12]], [[2004]] - 8:52 a.m.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3619661.stm Scale of Falluja violence emerges]''&quot;. BBC, [[April 12]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;
There were also reports of ambulances and aid convoys being used by the insurgents to smuggle weapons and fighters into the city.&lt;ref&gt;Navarro, Lourdes, &quot;''[http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2004/04/12/rebels_smuggle_supplies_into_iraqi_city/ Rebels smuggle supplies into Iraqi city]''&quot;. Associated Press, [[April 12]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt; Coalition officials said that the insurgents used mosques and schools as command posts and weapon-storage facilities. A suicide-bomb-vest factory was discovered by Marines.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/08/iraq.fallujah.ap/ Marines, insurgents wage furious battle for Fallujah]''&quot;. CNN.&lt;/ref&gt;

After several failed attempts at ceasefires, the U.S. backed out of the city. A Marine commander stated &quot;We don't want to turn Fallujah into [[Dresden]]&quot;. The U.S. handed authority of the city over to a former Iraqi general who had served under Saddam Hussein, and whose fighters the U.S. acknowledges may include former members of insurgency.

Afterwards, the city was referred to as &quot;free rebel town&quot;; banners in the city streets proclaimed victory over the United States, and some of its mosques praised the Iraqi insurgency. The general, [[Muhammed Latif]], told Reuters, &quot;&quot;I want the American soldier to return to his camp. What I want more is that he returns to the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekaran, Rajiv, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6897-2004May6.html Gamble Brings Old Uniforms Back Into Style]''&quot;. Washington Post Foreign Service, [[May 7]], [[2004]]; Page A01.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. marines encircled Fallujah with an earth wall, trying to control access to the city, allowing only women and children to leave the city. On [[June 19]], [[2004]], twenty two [[Iraq]]is, among them women and children, were killed in a [[United States|U.S.]] air strike on a residential neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2004/06/19/iraq_fallujah040619 U.S. defends deadly air strike]''&quot;. CBC, [[June 19]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt; Allawi condemned the rebellion and called upon the city to surrender [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], the leader of the [[Tawhid-e-Jihad]] group who is alleged to be hiding in Fallujah, or face aerial bombing by the United States.

===Muqtada al-Sadr===
On [[April 4]], [[2004]], coalition forces closed [[Shiite]] cleric [[Muqtada al-Sadr]]'s newspaper [[al-Hawza]], claiming that it contained incitements to violence. One example provided was that on [[February 26]], an article claimed that a suicide bombing in [[Iskandariya]] that killed 53 people was a rocket fired by the Americans, and not a car bomb. In response, al-Sadr launched a day of protests. During these protests, members of the Iraqi insurgency (who may or may not have been tied to al-Sadr) ambushed a Coalition patrol guarding a trash collecting unit in [[Sadr-City]] resulting in the deaths of 8 soldiers. Several dozen of al-Sadr's followers were killed during these protests.

The coalition responded by arresting one of al-Sadr's closest aides, leading to al-Sadr calling on his followers to rise up. The next days fighting erupted in many cities in southern Iraq, including [[Karbala]], [[Kut]], [[Nassiriya]] and [[Basra]]. The CPA announced the existence of a three-month-old arrest warrant, issued by an Iraqi judge, on al-Sadr, claiming that he was responsible for the killing of Coalition-aligned cleric [[Abdul Majid al-Khoei]]. The warrant itself inspired further opposition, as Khoei's own followers blamed Baathists for the murder, the Coalition-appointed Iraqi Minister of Justice stated that he had no knowledge of the warrant, and the Iraqi Jurists Association declared the warrant &quot;illegal&quot;. Al-Sadr, who had previously created his own parallel government and a militia called the al-Mahdi Army, instructed his followers to no longer follow along with the occupation, and suggested that they attack Coalition soldiers, and his followers took control of several southern cities, often with the support of local authorities and police.

During the first few days of the uprising al-Sadr stayed in [[Kufa]], where he traditionally had a large following. On [[April 7]] he moved to Najaf, into a building close to the shrine of the [[Imam Ali]], the holiest shrine in the Shia faith. After fierce fighting during the first days of the uprising, his followers took control over many cities in southern Iraq. In Kut the Ukrainian occupational contingent was forced out of the city by a rain of mortar fire. The Italians were contained inside their base in Nassiriya, and in Basra the governor's palace was occupied. In [[Karbala]], Polish and Bulgarian forces were able to hold their own after a battle lasting the whole night. The Alliance reacted by dispensing a reactionary force on [[April 8]] to Kut, forcing al-Sadr followers to melt away into the city's population. The same happened in most of the other cities and control was nominally ceded. Only Najaf and Kufa, which the Americans did not enter, remained effectively under the control of al-Sadr followers. The Coalition sent 2,500 U.S. Marines to Najaf to try to 'arrest or kill' al-Sadr.

Initially hopeful that al-Sistani would force al-Sadr to capitulate, the coalition was disappointed when, while he called for all sides to show restraint, he focused instead on condemning coalition activities in Fallujah. In mid-May 2004, a U.S. lead force began pushing into Najaf. In the process, they invaded several mosques to seize weaponry, and there were reports of damage to some of Shia Islam's holiest shrines. U.S. forces, using their superior fire power and air support, inflicted a steady stream of al-Mahdi army casualties; al-Sadr and hospital officials disputed the numbers, and both claimed that many of them were civilians. The al-Mahdi were only able to inflict few American casualties, but on [[May 17]], it was reported that the Al-Madhi army drove Italian troops from their base in [[Nasiriyah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunherald.com/mld/thesunherald/news/world/8684094.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp The Sun Herald (of south Mississippi) story] (from the [[Knight Ridder]] services) about the incident over the actions of the insurgents driving the Italian troops from their base in Nasiriyah called &quot;Libeccio&quot; (&quot;southwest wind&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; Ten Italians were wounded, along with 20 al-Mahdi army fighters wounded and two killed, in the assault. The base was peacefully retaken the next day in a negotiated settlement with local clan leaders.

While the Alliance continually insisted that he had little support, and there were limited clashes with the smaller SCIRI, he was seldom condemned by his more senior clerics. Islamic courts expanded their influence in areas he controlled. The [[Imam Ali]] mosque ended its call for prayers with a request for divine protection for him, and his followers were clearly large in number.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://www.boston.com/dailynews/137/world/Once_considered_fringe_al_SadrP.shtml Once considered fringe al Sadr movement now leads anti-U.S. fight]''&quot;. Boston.com (The New York Times Company), 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Many believed that al-Sistani did not speak out against al-Sadr for fear of turning Shiite against Shiite. A poll found that, in mid-May 2004, 32% of Iraqis strongly supported al-Sadr, and another 36% somewhat supported him.&lt;ref&gt;Ryu, Alisha, &quot;''Poll: [http://www.vnis.com/story.cfm?textnewsid=999 32% of Iraqi Respondents Strongly Support Moqtada al-Sadr]''&quot;. Voice of America News (via Veterans News and Information Service), [[May 24]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2004, al-Sadr attempted a second rebellion, and his al-Mahdi army again incited violence, especially in the [[Sadr city]] slum area of Baghdad, and in Najaf. U.S. forces responded by pushing into the areas of Najaf controlled by al-Mahdi, sending the militia reeling. Supported by [[helicopter gunships]], the U.S. military managed to kill several hundred al-Mahdi fighters, and further close in on the Iman Ali mosque, where al-Sadr had made his base. Brutal fighting raged between U.S. troops and al-Madhi militiamen in a cemetery outside the mosque. To avoid damaging the sacred mosque in a direct raid, a political solution was sought, and a deal was struck between al-Sistani and al-Sadr ended his rebellion. In September 2004, a program encouraged al-Madhi members in Sadr city to exchange their guns into authorities for a financial compensation, and the slum was almost fully pacified.

By August 2005, al-Sadr had adopted a more conciliatory tone, along with a much lower profile, saying &quot;I call upon all the believers to save the blood of the Muslims and to return to their homes&quot; after an outbreak of violence between some of his followers and those of [[Abdul Aziz al-Hakim]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/08/25/iraq.main/ One-day extension for Iraq constitution]; Shiites, Kurds again fail to reach consensus with Sunnis''&quot;. CNN, [[August 25]], [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hostages===
After  the fall of the Baath-regime,people  with varying agendas have taken foreign and Iraqi hostages, including citizens of both countries that supported and opposed the invasion. This includes citizens of [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Czech Republic]], [[France]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], [[Jordan]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]], [[Thailand]], [[Turkey]], [[Ukraine]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States|United States of America]].

The hostage-taking appears to be uncoordinated, with different groups making various demands. Some hostages are released whilst others are killed, sometimes by beheading. Several kidnappings have been claimed by the [[Jama'at al-Tawhid wal Jihad|Tawhid and Jihad]] (The Unity of God and Holy War) Islamist group, which changed its name to &quot;Al-Qaeda in Iraq&quot; in October 2004. The group was ran by the Jordanian-born Palestinian [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]]. The hostages who have been beheaded by Zarqawi's group, and possibly by Zarqawi himself, include Americans [[Nick Berg]], [[Eugene Armstrong]] and [[Jack Hensley]], South Korean [[Kim Sun-il]], [[Shosei Koda]] from Japan, and [[Kenneth Bigley]] from the UK. Italian [[Fabrizio Quattrocchi]] was shot in the head, possibly by another group, as was British aid worker [[Margaret Hassan]]. According to the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], at least 25 [[journalists]] have been kidnapped by armed groups in Iraq since April 2004, when insurgents began targeting foreigners for abduction.

While some hostagetaking seems to be politically motivated, a large number of hostages are taken by criminals as a means of obtaining cash. Iraqis presumed to have high incomes have esepcially been targeted. 

On the evening of [[March 4]], [[2005]], the car leading [[Giuliana Sgrena]], freshly liberated, along with two agents of the [[Sismi]], the Italian Military Intelligence service, was fired upon by U.S. troops. [[Nicola Calipari]], who had negotiated the liberation of the other eight Italian hostages, was killed, while Sgrena and the other agent were wounded; see [[Rescue of Giuliana Sgrena]].

===Fall-out===
As a result of the uprisings U.S. General [[John Abizaid]] in April 2004 requested an additional 10,000 troops be sent to Iraq after admitting that a number of Iraqi security personnel had abandoned their posts or joined the Iraqi insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Pamela, (Pentagon correspondent) &quot;''DOD: [http://washingtontimes.com/upi-breaking/20040412-053906-3504r.htm Security forces disappoint in Iraq]''&quot;. News World Communications, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; On [[April 16]], [[2004]], U.S. Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] announced that he had approved General Abizaid's request and had extended the tour of roughly 20,000 soldiers, who were scheduled to be rotated out of Iraq, by three months. A fresh mass grave was found near Ramadi, containing the bodies of over 350 Iraqis.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://www.realcities.com/mld/krwashington/8378962.htm Mass Grave of Dead Iraqi Insurgents and Civilians found]''&quot;. Real Cities. (ed., Originally from Knight Ridder News Coverage of Washington and the World).&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether this mass grave contained dead civilians and/or militants.

===Iraq Study Group Report===
At a news conference with the British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in Washington on [[6 December]] [[2006]], President [[George W. Bush]] commented the [[Iraq Study Group]]'s bipartisan report assessing the current situation of the US-led [[Iraq War]] and making policy recommendations. President Bush admitted for the first time that a ''&quot;new approach&quot;'' is needed in Iraq, that the situation in Iraq is ''&quot;bad there&quot;'' and that the task ahead was ''&quot;daunting&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6217834.stm|title=Bush ponders next Iraq move}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Bush said he would not accept every recommendation by the ISG panel but promised that he would take the report seriously. President Bush is expected to wait for three other studies from [[the Pentagon]], the [[US State Department]] and the [[National Security Council (USA)|National Security Council]] before charting the new course on Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/article2056247.ece|title=Cracks appear between Bush and Blair over need for talks with Iran and Syria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraq Coalition members departures==
{{see details|Multinational force in Iraq}}

The following countries were members of the &quot;[[Coalition of the Willing]]&quot; and withdrew their troops subsequently:
* [[Nicaragua]] withdrew in February 2004, claiming that they were too poor to pay for their deployment.
* The [[Netherlands]] reported that all Dutch military forces left Iraq by [[March 7]], [[2005]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://www.government.nl/actueel/dossieroverzicht/42_18993.jsp Dutch military mission to Iraq]''&quot;. Netherlands Government Information Service, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[South Korea]] did not withdraw troops, but on [[March 19]], [[2004]] canceled its plans to deploy an additional 3,600 troops to around [[Kirkuk]]; the troops were instead sent to [[Kurdistan]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://times.hankooki.com/plaza/ap_news.php?cur_date=20040408&amp;page=3 South Korea Considering Two New Sites in Iraq for Deployment]''&quot;.

* The [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings]] reinvigorated popular opposition to the occupation in [[Spain]]; the ruling [[Partido Popular]] was accused of deceiving the public by blaming the attack on [[ETA]] rather than fundamentalist Muslims. During national elections held three days later, the anti-war [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], headed by [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], gained power. On [[April 17]], [[2004]], the newly-installed Zapatero, fulfilling a campaign promise, ordered the immediate withdrawal of Spanish troops from Iraq.
* The troops of the [[Dominican Republic]] left Iraq in early-May 2004.
* [[Honduras]] pulled all troops out of Iraq in May 2004.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/04/19/spain.withdraw/ Honduras rushes to pull out troops]''&quot;. CNN, [[April 20]], [[2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Philippines]] put a hold on new deployments and were planning to pull out shortly, but on [[July 16]], [[2004]], the [[Philippines]] ordered the withdrawal of all of its troops in Iraq in order to comply with the demands of terrorists holding Filipino citizen [[Angelo de la Cruz]] as a hostage. De la Cruz was confirmed released on [[July 20]], after all Philippine troops had left Iraq.
* [[Thailand]], who was already planning not to renew their troop commitment after September, withdrew in late-August 2004.&lt;ref&gt;James, Nilloc, &quot;''[http://www.thaipro.com/thailand_00/293_thailand-troops-iraq.htm Thai troops begin withdrawal from Iraq]''&quot;.

* [[New Zealand]] withdrew its 60 troops in late-September 2004. New Zealand supplied troops after the new Iraq government had been put into place. It did not support or take part in the [[Coalition of the willing]].
* [[Portugal]] withdrew in February 2005.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/15/iraq/main680400.shtml More Nations Pulling Out Of Iraq]''&quot;. CBS News, [[March 15]], [[2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Italy]] also announced the withdrawal of their troops on [[March 16]], [[2005]], a few days after the controversial killing of [[Sismi]] agent [[Nicola Calipari]] and injury of Italian journalist [[Giuliana Sgrena]] by U.S. troops at a mobile [[roadblock]] (see [[Rescue of Giuliana Sgrena]]). Eventually, Prime Minister Berlusconi took back his word after discussions with George W. Bush. The last Italian troops left Iraq on [[December 1]], [[2006]].
* [[Bulgaria]] did not pull out, but let any of its troops who wanted to leave go home; 62 out of 480 had left as of [[April 17]], [[2004]].

* While not a departure, in February 2007 [[Tony Blair]] announced that Operation Sinbad, a joint British-Iraqi operation against Shiite militias in Basra, was &quot;now complete&quot;, and news sources report that Blair will announce the withdrawal of 1500 of Britain's 7000 troops in southern Iraq. A senior British commander in southern Iraq called the move &quot;another important milestone on the road to Iraqi self-reliance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/world/europe/21britain.html/ Britain to announce trimming of Iraq force] - The New York Times, Alan Cowell, [[February 21]], [[2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. military patrolling==

During the &quot;post-war&quot; Iraq occupation, occupying forces have turned their attention to enforcing order through [[patrolling]]. These patrols faced [[insurgent]]s who conduct ambushes using assault rifles, rocket propelled grenades, and carefully placed and timed explosives. The patrols require armored vehicles capable of stopping at least small arms fire of 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm [[machine gun]] rounds along with mandatory external weapons platforms and tracking equipment. Experience is also key in detecting any potentially threatening, out of place car, box or person while following the [[rules of engagement]] that dictate a passive-but-ready posture. Patrolling soldiers spend nearly eight hours a day in sector and accrue nearly 30 patrols per month.

==U.S. permanent facilities==
In October 2004, Iraq's interim government transferred to U.S. ownership {{convert|104|acre|km2}} of land beside the Tigris River in Baghdad for construction of a [[Embassy of the United States in Baghdad|new U.S. embassy]]. The new facility will be the largest of its kind in the world, the size of [[Vatican City]], with the population of a small town, its own defense force, self-contained power and water. A few details of the embassy complex are available from a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee report, though many of the details remain secret. Its construction is budgeted at $592 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/world/3876208.html|title=US's embassy is biggest secret in Baghdad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the embassy complex, four “super bases” are being built for permanent deployment. One would be adjacent to Baghdad, two would be close to the southern and northern oil fields and the fourth would be in the west towards Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060831015421/http://www.oxfordresearchgroup.org.uk/publications/paulrogers/April06.htm|title=From Cold War to Long War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. is in the process of building 14 bases known as enduring bases. Four are unknown as to name and location. The other ten are: Green Zone in Baghdad, Camp Anaconda at Balad Airbase, Camp Taji in Taji, Camp Falcon-Al-Sarq in Baghdad, Post Freedom in Mosul, Camp Victory-Al Nasr at Baghdad Airfield, Camp Marez at Mosul Airfield, Camp Renegade in Kirkuk, Camp Speicher in Tikrit and Camp Fallujuh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070419131118/http://www.fcnl.org/iraq/bases_text.htm|title= If the U.S. is ultimately leaving Iraq, why is the military building 'permanent' bases?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/iraq-intro.htm|title=Iraq Facilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''creation-evolution controversy''' (also termed the '''creation vs. evolution debate''' or the '''origins debate''') is a recurring [[politics|political dispute]] about the origins of [[Age of the Earth|the Earth]], [[human evolution|humanity]], [[origin of life|life]], and [[Big Bang|the universe]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Hovind|2006}}, for example.&lt;/ref&gt; between those who espouse the validity and superiority of a particular religiously-based [[Creation according to Genesis|creation theology]] and the [[scientific consensus]], particularly in the field of [[evolutionary biology]], but also in the fields of [[geology]], [[palaeontology]], [[thermodynamics]], [[nuclear physics]] and [[cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/index.html ''An Index to Creationist Claims''] , Mark Isaak, [[Talkorigins Archive]],Copyright © 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
This debate is most prevalent in generally conservative regions of the [[United States]]. There is little serious debate on the subject outside the United States. It is often portrayed as part of the [[culture war]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|p=247-263}} Chapter titled ''Modern Culture Wars''. See also {{harvnb|Ruse|1999|p=26}}, who writes &quot;One thing that historians delighted in showing is that, contrary to the usually held tale of [[conflict thesis|science and religion being always opposed]]...religion and theologically inclined philosophy have frequently been very significant factors in the forward movement of science.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; While the controversy has a long history,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=3-240}}&lt;/ref&gt; today it is mainly over what constitutes good [[science]],&lt;ref&gt;''See: ''&lt;br&gt;

*Kitzmiller vs. Dover Area School District, pages 7-9, also pages 64-90&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate also focuses on issues such as the definition of science (and of what constitutes scientific research and evidence), science education (and whether the teaching of the scientific consensus view should be 'balanced' by also teaching fringe theories), [[free speech]], [[separation of Church and State]], and theology (particularly how different Christian denominations interpret the [[Book of Genesis]]).

Within the [[scientific community]] and [[academia]] the [[level of support for evolution]] is essentially universal,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Myers|2006}}; {{harvnb|NSTA|2007}}; {{harvnb|IAP|2006}}; {{harvnb|AAAS|2006}}; and {{harvnb|Pinholster|2006}}; [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 83 of 139|Ruling, Kitzmiller v. Dover page 83]]&lt;/ref&gt; while support for [[biblical literalism|biblically-literal]] accounts or other creationist alternatives is very small among scientists, and virtually nonexistent among those in the relevant fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|p=258}} &quot;Virtually no secular scientists accepted the doctrines of [[creation science]]; but that did not deter creation scientists from advancing scientific arguments for their position.&quot; See also {{Harvnb|Martz &amp; McDaniel|1987|Ref=CITEREFMartzMcDaniel1987|p=23}}, a Newsweek article which states &quot;By one count there are some 700 scientists (out of a total of 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists) who give credence to creation-science, the general theory that complex life forms did not evolve but appeared 'abruptly'.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate is sometimes portrayed as being between science and religion. However, as the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] states:
{{cquote|Today, many religious denominations accept that biological evolution has produced the diversity of living things over billions of years of Earth’s history. Many have issued statements observing that evolution and the tenets of their faiths are compatible. Scientists and theologians have written eloquently about their awe and wonder at the history of the universe and of life on this planet, explaining that they see no conflict between their faith in God and the evidence for evolution. Religious denominations that do not accept the occurrence of evolution tend to be those that believe in strictly literal interpretations of religious texts.|20px|20px|''Science, Evolution, and Creationism''|National Academy of Sciences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== History of the controversy ==
{{main|History of the creation-evolution controversy}}
{{seealso|History of evolutionary thought|}}

=== Ancient creation-evolution controversies ===

[[Lactantius]] (c.250 - c.330) in his Divine Institutes refutes rudimentary evolutionary thought by discrediting [[abiogenesis]], specifically in regards to the origin of [[Man]].  &quot;... [M]en were not born from the ground throughout the world...but one man ([[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]) was formed by God and from that one man all the earth was filled with the human race, as again took place after the Deluge ([[Noah's Flood]]).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Divine Institutes'' 6.10-11, trans. W. Fletcher, in ''The Ante-Nicene Fathers 7''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creation-evolution controversy in the age of Darwin ===
{{seealso|Reaction to Darwin's theory}}
[[Image:Darwin ape.jpg|right|thumb|A satirical image of [[Charles Darwin]] as an ape from 1871 reflects part of the social controversy over whether humans and apes share a [[human evolution|common lineage]].]]

The creation-evolution controversy originated in Europe and North America in the late eighteenth century when discoveries in [[geology]] led to various theories of an ancient earth, and [[fossil]]s showing past extinctions prompted [[History of evolutionary thought|early ideas of evolution]], notably [[Lamarckism]]. In England these ideas of continuing change were seen as a threat to the fixed social order, and were harshly repressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond &amp; Moore|1991|Ref=CITEREFDesmondMoore1991|p= 34-35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions eased, and in 1844 the controversial ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation|Vestiges]]'' popularised [[transmutation of species]]. The scientific establishment dismissed it scornfully and the [[Church of England]] reacted with fury, but many [[Unitarian]]s, [[Quaker]]s and [[Baptist]]s opposed to the privileges of the [[Established church]] favoured its ideas of God acting through laws. Publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[the Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection]]'' in 1859 brought scientific credibility to [[evolution]], and made it more respectable.&lt;ref&gt;''See&quot;:&lt;br&gt;
*{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2006}};
*{{Harvnb|Desmond &amp; Moore|1991|Ref=CITEREFDesmondMoore1991|p=321-323, 503-505}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was intense interest in the religious implications of Darwin's book, but the Church of England's attention was largely diverted by theological controversy over ''[[higher criticism]]'' set out in ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' by [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Christian]] authors, some of whom expressed support for Darwin, as did many [[nonconformist]]s. The Reverend [[Charles Kingsley]] openly supported the idea of God working through evolution. However, many Christians were opposed to the idea and even some of Darwin's close friends and supporters including [[Charles Lyell]] and [[Asa Gray]] could not accept some of his ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaas&quot;&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/images_Doser/Publications/evol_dialogue_study_guide.pdf AAAS Evolution Dialogues: Science, Ethics and Religion] study guide (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Huxley]], who strongly promoted Darwin's ideas while campaigning to end the dominance of science by the [[clergy]], coined the term ''[[agnosticism|agnostic]]'' to describe his position that God’s existence is unknowable, and Darwin also took this position,&lt;ref name=&quot;aaas&quot; /&gt; but evolution was also taken up by prominent [[atheism|atheists]] including [[Edward Aveling]] and [[Ludwig Büchner]] and criticised, in the words of one reviewer, as &quot;tantamount to atheism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''See:&lt;br&gt;

Creationists during this period were largely [[Premillennialism|premillennialists]], whose belief in [[Jesus Christ|Christ's]] return depended on a quasi-literal reading of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were not as concerned about geology, freely granting scientists any time they needed before the [[Garden of Eden]] to account for scientific observations, such as fossils and geological findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=14-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the immediate post-Darwinian era, few scientists or [[cleric]]s rejected the antiquity of the earth or the progressive nature of the [[fossil|fossil record]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Numbers_1992_p17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, few attached geological significance to the Biblical flood, unlike subsequent creationists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Numbers_1992_p17&quot; /&gt; Evolutionary skeptics, creationist leaders and skeptical scientists were usually willing either to adopt a figurative reading of the first chapter of Genesis, or to allow that the six days of creation were not necessarily 24-hour days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=18}}, noting that this applies to published or public skeptics. Many or most Christians may have held on to a literal six days of creation, but these views were rarely expressed in books and journals. Exceptions are also noted, such as literal interpretations published by Eleazar Lord (1788-1871) and David Nevins Lord (1792-1880). However, the observation that evolutionary critics had a relaxed interpretation of Genesis is supported by specifically enumerating: [[Louis Agassiz]] (1807-1873); [[Arnold Henry Guyot]] (1807-1884); [[John William Dawson]] (1820-1899); Enoch Fitch Burr (1818-1907); George D. Armstrong (1813-1899); [[Charles Hodge]], theologian (1797-1878); [[James Dwight Dana]] (1813-1895); [[Edward Hitchcock]], clergyman and respected Amherst College geologist, (1793-1864); Reverend [[Herbert W. Morris]] (1818-1897); H. L. Hastings (1833?-1899); Luther T. Townsend (1838-1922; [[Alexander Patterson]], Presbyterian evangelist who published ''The Other Side of Evolution Its Effects and Fallacy''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creationism===
{{main|History of creationism}}
{{seealso|Creation and evolution in public education}}

In the [[United States of America]] Creationism was widely accepted and was even considered a foundational truth, but there was no official resistance to evolution by mainline denominations.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaas&quot; /&gt; Around the start of the 20th century some [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] scholars had ideas accommodating evolution, such as [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|B. B. Warfield]] who saw it as a natural law expressing God’s will. However, development of the [[eugenics]] movement led many Catholics to reject evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaas&quot; /&gt; In this enterprise they received little aid from conservative Christians in Britain and Europe. In Britain this has been attributed to their minority status leading to a more tolerant, less militant theological tradition. The main British Creationist movement in this period was the [[Evolution Protest Movement]], formed in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p161&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Butler Act and the Scopes monkey trial====
{{main|Scopes trial}}
[[Image:Scopes trial.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Clarence Darrow]] and [[William Jennings Bryan]] chat in court during the [[Scopes trial]].]]

In the aftermath of [[World War I]], the [[Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy]] brought a surge of opposition to the idea of evolution, and following the campaigning of [[William Jennings Bryan]] several [[U.S. state|state]]s introduced legislation prohibiting the teaching of evolution.  By [[1925]], such legislation was being considered in 15 states, and passed in some states, such as Tennessee.  The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] offered to defend anyone who wanted to bring a test case against one of these laws.  [[John T. Scopes]] accepted, and he confessed to teaching his [[Tennessee]] class evolution in defiance of the [[Butler Act]].  The textbook in question was ''Hunter's Civic Biology'' (1914). The trial was widely publicized by [[H. L. Mencken]] among others, and is commonly referred to as the [[Scopes Monkey Trial]]. Scopes was convicted; however, the widespread publicity galvanized proponents of evolution. When the case was appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court, the Court overturned the decision on a technicality (the judge had assessed the fine when the jury had been required to).  Although it overturned the conviction, the Court decided that the law was not in violation of the First Amendment.  The Court held,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;We are not able to see how the prohibition of teaching the theory that man has descended from a lower order of animals gives preference to any religious establishment or mode of worship. So far as we know, there is no religious establishment or organized body that has in its creed or confession of faith any article denying or affirming such a theory.&quot;  Scopes v. State  289 S.W. 363, 367 (Tenn. 1927).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The interpretation of the [[Establishment clause]] up to that time was that Congress could not establish a particular religion as the ''State'' religion.  Consequently, the Court held that the ban on the teaching of evolution did not violate the Establishment clause, because it did not establish one religion as the &quot;State religion.&quot;  As a result of the holding, the teaching of evolution remained illegal in Tennessee, and continued campaigning succeeded in removing evolution from school textbooks throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''See:&lt;br&gt;

==== Daniel v. Waters ====
{{main|Daniel v. Waters}}

Daniel v. Waters was a [[1975]] legal case in which the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] struck down [[Tennessee]]'s law regarding the teaching of &quot;equal time&quot; of [[evolution]] and [[creationism]] in [[public school]] [[science]] classes because it violated the [[Establishment clause]] of the [[US Constitution]]. Following this ruling, creationism was stripped of overt biblical references and renamed [[creation science]], and several states passed Acts requiring that this be given equal time with teaching of evolution.

=== Creation Science ===
{{main|Creation Science}}

As biologists grew more and more confident in evolution as the central defining principle of biology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=248,250}}, see also {{harvnb|Dobzhansky|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; American membership in churches favoring increasingly literal interpretations of Scripture rose, with the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] and [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod]] outpacing all other denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; With growth, these churches became better equipped to promulgate a creationist message, with their own colleges, schools, publishing houses, and broadcast media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the first major modern creationist book was published: [[Henry M. Morris]] and [[John C. Whitcomb|John C. Whitcomb Jr.'s]] ''[[The Genesis Flood]].'' Morris and Whitcomb argued that creation was literally 6 days long, that humans lived concurrently with dinosaurs, and that God created each 'kind' of life individually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=255}},{{Harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=xi,200-208}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the strength of this, Morris became a popular speaker, spreading anti-evolutionary ideas at fundamentalist churches, colleges, and conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris' Creation Science Research Center (CSRC) rushed publication of biology text books that promoted creationism, and also published other books such as Kelly Segrave's sensational ''Sons of God Return'' that dealt with [[UFOlogy]], [[flood geology]], and [[demonology]] against Morris' objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=284-285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the CSRC broke up
over a divide between sensationalism and a more intellectual approach, and Morris founded the [[Institute for Creation Research]], which was promised to be controlled and operated by scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=284-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Morris and others who supported flood geology adopted the scientific sounding terms ''scientific creationism'' and ''creation science''.&lt;ref&gt;Quoting {{harvnb|Larson|2004|p=255-256}}: &quot;Fundamentalists no longer merely denounced Darwinism as false; they offered a scientific-sounding alternative of their own, which they called either 'scientific creationism (as distinct from religious creationism) or 'creation science' (as opposed to evolution science.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The flood geologists effectively co-opted &quot;the generic creationist label for their hyperliteralist views&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Larson|2004|p=254-255}}, {{Harvnb|Numbers|1998|p=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Court cases ====
===== Epperson v. Arkansas =====
{{main|Epperson v. Arkansas}}

In 1928, [[Arkansas]] adopted a law which prohibited any public school or university from teaching &quot;the theory or doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals&quot; and from using any textbook which taught the same, prohibiting the teaching of [[evolution]] in the public schools. During the forty years the Arkansas law was in effect, no one was ever prosecuted for violating it. In the mid-1960s the secretary of the Arkansas Education Association sought to challenge the law as a violation of the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]]. In 1968 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] invalidated the statute, ruling it unconstitutional because it violated the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]]. Mandates that [[creation science]] be taught were not ruled unconstitutional by the Court until the 1987 case ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]''.

===== McLean v. Arkansas =====
{{main|McLean v. Arkansas}}

In 1982 another case in [[Arkansas]] ruled that the Arkansas &quot;Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act&quot; was unconstitutional because it violated the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|establishment clause]] of the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]]. Much of the transcript of the case was lost, including [[evidence (law)|evidence]] from [[Francisco J. Ayala|Francisco Ayala]].

===== Edwards v. Aguillard =====
{{main|Edwards v. Aguillard}}

In the early 1980s, the [[Louisiana]] legislature passed a law titled the &quot;Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science in Public School Instruction Act&quot;. The Act did not require teaching either [[creationism]] or [[evolution]], but did require that when evolutionary science was taught, the &quot;creation science&quot; had to be taught as well. Creationists had lobbied aggressively for the law, arguing that the Act was about academic freedom for teachers, an argument adopted by the state in support of the Act. Lower courts ruled that the State's actual purpose was to promote the religious doctrine of &quot;[[creation science]],&quot; but the State appealed to the Supreme Court. The similar case in McLean v. Arkansas had also decided against creationism. Mclean v. Arkansas however was not appealed to the federal level, creationists instead thinking that they had better chances with Edwards v. Aguillard. In 1987 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that the Act was unconstitutional, because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion. At the same time, however, it held that &quot;teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to school children might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction&quot; leaving open the door for a handful of proponents of creation science to evolve their arguments into the iteration of creationism that came to be known as [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Kitzmiller v.

{{main|Intelligent design}}
{{seealso|Neo-creationism|Intelligent design movement|Teach the Controversy|Critical Analysis of Evolution|}}

In response to [[Edwards v. Aguillard]], the [[Neo-creationism|Neo-Creationist]] [[intelligent design movement]] was formed around the [[Discovery Institute]]'s [[Center for Science and Culture]]. Its goal is to restate creationism in terms more likely to be well received by the public, policy makers, educators, and the scientific community, and makes the claim that &quot;certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as [[natural selection]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovery.org/csc/topQuestions.php#questionsAboutIntelligentDesign|title=Top Questions-1.What is the theory of intelligent design?|publisher=[[Discovery Institute]]|accessdate=2007-05-13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been viewed as a &quot;scientific&quot; approach to creationism by creationists, but is widely rejected as unscientific by the science community (see for example, [[list of scientific societies rejecting intelligent design]]).

==== Controversy in recent times ====
{{see also|Politics of creationism|Intelligent design in politics}}

The controversy continues to this day, with the [[mainstream]] [[scientific consensus]] on the origins and evolution of life challenged by creationist organizations and religious groups who desire to uphold some form of creationism (usually [[young earth creationism]], [[creation science]], [[old earth creationism]] or [[intelligent design]]) as an alternative. Most of these groups are explicitly Christian, and more than one sees the debate as part of the Christian mandate to [[evangelism|evangelize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Verderame|2007}},{{harvnb|Simon|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some see science and religion as being diametrically opposed views which cannot be reconciled. More accommodating viewpoints, held by many mainstream churches and many scientists, consider science and religion to be separate categories of thought, which ask fundamentally different questions about reality and posit different avenues for investigating it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dewey|1994|p=31}}, and {{Harvnb|Wiker|2003}}, summarizing Gould.&lt;/ref&gt; Public opinion in regards to the concepts of Evolution, Creationism, and Intelligent Design is fluctuating.

More recently, the [[Intelligent Design movement]] has taken an anti-evolution position which avoids any direct appeal to religion. Scientists argue that [[Intelligent design]] does not represent any research program within the mainstream scientific community, and is essentially creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2004|p=258}} &quot;Virtually no secular scientists accepted the doctrines of creation science; but that did not deter creation scientists from advancing scientific arguments for their position.&quot; See also {{Harvnb|Martz &amp; McDaniel|1987|Ref=CITEREFMartzMcDaniel1987|p=23}}, a Newsweek article which states &quot;By one count there are some 700 scientists (out of a total of 480,000 U.S. earth and life scientists) who give credence to creation-science, the general theory that complex life forms did not evolve but appeared 'abruptly'.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Its leading proponent, the [[Discovery Institute]], made widely publicised claims that it was a new science, though the only paper arguing for it published in a scientific journal was accepted in questionable circumstances and quickly disavowed in the [[Sternberg peer review controversy]], with the Biological Society of Washington stating that it did not meet the journal's scientific standards, was a &quot;significant departure&quot; from the journal's normal subject area and was published at the former editor's sole discretion, &quot;contrary to typical editorial practices&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biolsocwash.org/id_statement.html ''Statement from the Council of the Biological Society of Washington'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[George W.

==== Kansas evolution hearings ====
{{main|Kansas evolution hearings}}
In the push by intelligent design advocates to introduce intelligent design in public school science classrooms, the hub of the [[intelligent design movement]], the [[Discovery Institute]], arranged to conduct hearings to review the evidence for evolution in the light of its [[Critical Analysis of Evolution]] lesson plans. The Kansas Evolution Hearings were a series of hearings held in [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Kansas]] May 5 to May 12, 2005. The Kansas State Board of Education eventually adopted the institute's Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plans over objections of the State Board Science Hearing Committee, and electioneering on behalf of conservative Republican candidates for the Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.6newslawrence.com/news/2006/jul/07/many_question_groups_move_elections_nearing/ Some question group's move with elections nearing] 6News Lawrence, Lawrence Journal-World.

The moderate Republican and Democrats gaining seats vowed to overturn the 2005 school science standards and adopt those recommended by a State Board Science Hearing Committee that were rejected by the previous board, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14137751/ Evolution’s foes lose ground in Kansas] MSNBC, August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[February 13]], [[2007]], the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005.

==== The Dover Trial ====
{{main|Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District}}

Following the [[Edwards v. Aguillard]] trial in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in which the Court ruled that a [[Louisiana]] law requiring that [[creation science]] be taught in public schools whenever [[evolution]] was taught was unconstitutional, because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion, creationists renewed their efforts to introduce creationism into public school science classes. This effort resulted in [[intelligent design]], which sought to avoid legal prohibitions by leaving the source of creation an unnamed and undefined [[intelligent designer]], as opposed to [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=20418&amp;print=yes&amp;units=all The &quot;Evolution&quot; of Creationism] Timeline: how creationism has &quot;evolved&quot;. [[People for the American Way]].&lt;/ref&gt; This ultimately resulted in the &quot;Dover Trial,&quot; Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, which went to trial on [[September 26]], [[2005]] and was decided on [[December 20]], [[2005]] in favor of the plaintiffs, who charged that a mandate that intelligent design be taught in public school science classrooms was an unconstitutional establishment of religion. The 139 page [[:s:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|opinion of ''Kitzmiller v. Dover'']] was hailed as a landmark decision, firmly establishing that creationism and intelligent design were religious teachings and not areas of legitimate scientific research.

== Viewpoints ==
=== Young Earth creationism ===
{{main|Young Earth creationism}}
{{seealso|Creation science|Flood geology}}

Young Earth creationism is the belief that the Earth was created by [[God]] within the last 10,000 years, literally as described in [[Creation according to Genesis|Genesis]], within the approximate timeframe of biblical genealogies (detailed for example in the [[Ussher chronology]]). Young Earth creationists often believe that the [[Universe]] has a similar age as the Earth. [[Creationist cosmologies]] are attempts by some creationist thinkers to give the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other Young-Earth timeframes. This belief generally has a basis in a [[Biblical literalism|literal]] and [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]] interpretation of the Bible.

=== Old Earth creationism ===
{{main|Old Earth creationism}}

{{seealso|Gap creationism|Day-Age Creationism|Progressive creationism}}

Old Earth creationism holds that the [[universe|physical universe]] was created by God, but that the creation event of Genesis is not to be taken strictly literally. This group generally believes that the [[age of the Universe]] and the [[age of the Earth]] are as described by [[astronomers]] and [[geologists]], but that details of the [[evolutionary theory]] are questionable. Old Earth creationists interpret the [[Creation according to Genesis|creation accounts of Genesis]] in a number of ways, that each differ from the six, consecutive, 24-hour day creation of the [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] Young Earth Creationist view.

=== Neo-Creationism ===
{{main|Neo-Creationism}}
{{seealso|Intelligent design}}

Neo-Creationists intentionally distance themselves from other forms of creationism, preferring to be known as wholly separate from creationism as a philosophy. Their goal is to restate creationism in terms more likely to be well received by the public, education policy makers and the [[scientific community]]. It aims to re-frame the debate over the [[origin of life|origins of life]] in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture, and to bring the debate before the public. Neo-creationists may be either Young Earth or Old Earth Creationists, and hold a range of underlying theological viewpoints (e.g. on the interpretation of the Bible). Neo-Creationism currently exists in the form of the [[intelligent design movement]], which has a [[intelligent design movement#The 'big tent' strategy|'big tent' strategy]] making it inclusive of many Young Earth Creationists (such as [[Paul Nelson (creationist)|Paul Nelson]] and [[Percival Davis]]).

=== Theistic evolution ===
{{main|Theistic evolution}}
{{seealso|Naturalism (philosophy)|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church|Clergy Letter Project}}

Theistic evolution, also known as &quot;evolutionary creationism,&quot; is the general view that, instead of faith being in opposition to biological evolution, some or all classical religious teachings about [[God]] and [[creation myth|creation]] are compatible with some or all of modern [[scientific theory]], including specifically [[evolution]]. It generally views evolution as a tool used by God, who is both the [[first cause]] and [[Immanence|immanent]] sustainer/upholder of the universe; it is therefore well accepted by people of strong [[theism|theistic]] (as opposed to [[deism|deistic]]) convictions. Theistic evolution can synthesize with the [[day-age creationism|day-age]] interpretation of the [[creation according to Genesis|Genesis creation account]]; however most adherents consider that the first chapters of Genesis should not be interpreted as a &quot;literal&quot; description, but rather as a [[framework view|literary framework]] or [[allegory]].

This position does not generally exclude the viewpoint of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]], a long standing convention of the [[scientific method]] in [[science]].

Theistic evolutionists have frequently been prominent in opposing creationism (including intelligent design). Notable examples have been biologist [[Kenneth R. Miller]] and theologian [[John Haught]] (both [[Catholics]]), who testified for the plaintiffs in [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]. Another example is the [[Clergy Letter Project]], an organization that has created and maintains a statement signed by American Christian clergy of different denominations rejecting creationism, with specific reference to points raised by intelligent design proponents. Theistic evolutionists have also been active in Citizens Alliances for Science that oppose the introduction of creationism into public school science classes (one example being evangelical Christian geologist [[Keith B. Miller]], who is a prominent board member of [[Kansas Citizens for Science]]).

=== Naturalistic evolution ===
{{seealso|Metaphysical naturalism}}

Naturalistic evolution is the position of acceptance of biological evolution and of [[metaphysical naturalism]] (and thus rejection of [[theism]] and [[theistic evolution]]).

== Arguments relating to the definition, limits and philosophy of science ==

Critiques such as those based on the distinction between theory and fact are often leveled against unifying concepts within scientific disciplines. Principles such as [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], [[Occam's Razor]] or [[parsimony]], and the [[Copernican principle]] are claimed to be the result of a [[bias]] within science toward [[philosophical naturalism]], which is equated by many [[creationists]] with [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1998}}, {{harvnb|Hodge|1874|p=177}}, {{harvnb|Wiker|2003}}, {{harvnb|Peters &amp; Hewlett|2005|Ref=CITEREFPetersHewlett2005|p=5}}--Peters and Hewlett argue that the atheism of many evolutionary supporters must be removed from the debate&lt;/ref&gt; In countering this claim, [[Philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] use the term [[Naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]] to refer to the long standing convention in science of the [[scientific method]]. The [[methodology|methodological]] assumption is that [[observation|observable]] events in [[nature]] are explained only by natural causes, without assuming the existence or non-existence of the [[supernatural]], and therefore supernatural explanations for such events are outside the realm of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lenski|2000|p=Conclusions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists claim that supernatural explanations should not be excluded and that scientific work is paradigmatically close-minded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because modern science tries to rely on the minimization of [[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]] assumptions, error, and [[subjectivity]], as well as on avoidance of [[Francis Bacon|Baconian idols]], it remains neutral on subjective subjects such as [[religion]] or [[morality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Einstein|1930|p=1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream proponents accuse the creationists of conflating the two in a form of [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawkins|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that evolution is a [[theory]], not a fact, has often been made against the exclusive teaching of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1993|p=63}}, {{Harvnb|Tolson|2005}}, {{harvnb|Moran|1993}} ; [http://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/cobb%20county%20decision.pdf ''Selman v. Cobb County School District]''. US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (2005); Talk. Origins; Bill Moyers ''et al'', 2004. &quot;[http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript349_full.html#dawkins ''Now'' with Bill Moyers].&quot; PBS. Accessed 2006-01-29. Interview with Richard Dawkins&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is related to a common misconception about the technical meaning of &quot;theory&quot; that is used by scientists. In common usage, &quot;theory&quot; often refers to conjectures, hypotheses, and unproven assumptions. However, in science, &quot;theory&quot; usually means &quot;a plausible or scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster online dictionary. www.m-w.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploring this issue, [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''[[Evolution]] is a theory. It is also a fact. And [[fact]]s and [[theories]] are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. Facts are the world's data. [[Theories]] are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts. Facts do not go away when scientists debate rival theories to explain them. Einstein's theory of [[gravitation]] replaced Newton's, but apples did not suspend themselves in mid-air, pending the outcome. And humans evolved from ape-like ancestors whether they did so by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s proposed mechanism or by some other yet to be discovered.''

=== Falsifiability ===

[[Philosophy of science|Philosopher of science]] [[Karl Popper|Karl R. Popper]] set out the concept of [[falsifiability]] as a way to distinguish science and pseudoscience: Testable theories are scientific, but those that are untestable are not.&lt;ref&gt;''See:&lt;br&gt;
*{{harvnb|Number|1992|p=247}};
*Wilkins, John S, [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolphil/falsify.html Evolution and Philosophy: Is Evolution Science, and What Does 'Science' Mean?], TalkOrigins Archive
&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''Unended Quest'', Popper declared &quot;I have come to the conclusion that Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory but a ''[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[research]] [[Program (management)|programme]]'', a possible framework for testable scientific theories,&quot; while pointing out it had &quot;scientific character&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1976|p=168 and 172}} quoted in {{harvnb|Kofahl|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In what one sociologist derisively called &quot;Popper-chopping,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Unknown sociologist quoted in {{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; opponents of evolution seized upon Popper's definition to claim [[evolution]] was not a science, and claimed creationism was an equally valid metaphysical research program.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kofahl|1989}} as quoted by {{harvnb|Numbers|1992|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Duane Gish]], a leading Creationist proponent, wrote in a letter to Discover magazine (July 1981): &quot;[[Stephen Jay Gould]] states that creationists claim creation is a scientific theory. This is a false accusation. Creationists have repeatedly stated that neither creation nor evolution is a scientific theory (and each is equally religious).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewin|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popper responded to news that his conclusions were being used by anti-evolutionary forces by affirming that evolutionary theories regarding the origins of life on earth were [[science|scientific]] because &quot;their hypotheses can in many cases be tested.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p274&lt;/ref&gt; However, creationists claimed that a key evolutionary concept, that all life on Earth is descended from a single common ancestor, was not mentioned as testable by Popper, and claimed it never would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kofahl|1981|p=873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, Popper wrote admiringly of the value of Darwin's theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA211_1.html Talkorigins summary of Karl Popper attitudes towards evolution]&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few years later, Popper changed his mind, and later wrote, &quot;''I still believe that natural selection works in this way as a research programme. Nevertheless, I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I am glad to have an opportunity to make a recantation''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''See:&lt;br&gt;
*''Natural selection and the emergence of mind'', Karl Popper, Dialectica 32(3/4): 339—355, 1978
*[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_5_28/ai_n6194235/pg_1 ''Did Popper refute evolution?''], Massimo Pigliucci, [[Skeptical Inquirer]], Sept-Oct 2004
&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate among some scientists and philosophers of science on the applicability of falsifiability in science continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruse|1999|p=13-37}}, which discusses conflicting ideas about science among [[Karl Popper]], [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]], and their disciples.&lt;/ref&gt; However, simple falsifiability tests for [[common descent]] have been offered by some scientists: For instance, [[biologist]] and prominent critic of creationism [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[J.B.S. Haldane]] both pointed out that if [[fossil]] [[rabbit]]s were found in the [[Precambrian]] [[era (geology)|era]], a time before most similarly complex lifeforms had evolved, &quot;that would completely blow [[evolution]] out of the water.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by {{harvnb|Wallis|2005|p=32}}. Also see {{harvnb|Dawkins|1986}} and {{harvnb|Dawkins|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wallis|2005|p=6}} [[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins]] quoting [[J.B.S. Haldane|Haldane]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Falsifiability has also caused problems for creationists: In his 1982 decision [[McLean v. Arkansas|McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education]], Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William R. Overton]] used falsifiability as one basis for his ruling against the teaching of creation science in the public schools, ultimately declaring it &quot;simply not science.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dorman|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflation of science and religion ===

Many of the most vocal creationists blur the boundaries between criticisms of modern science, [[philosophy]], and culture. They often conjoin their arguments focused on the science of evolution with [[doctrine|doctrinal]] statements or [[Evangelism|evangelistic]] attempts.  This can be a central focus of [[apologetics]]. For example, in explanation for his &quot;struggle&quot; against evolution, prominent creationist [[Ken Ham]] has declared &quot;the [[Lord]] has not just called us to knock down evolution, but to help in restoring the foundation of the [[gospel]] in our society. We believe that if the [[church]]es took up the tool of [[Approaches to evangelism#Creation evangelism|Creation Evangelism]] in society, not only would we see a stemming of the tide of [[humanism|humanistic philosophy]], but we would also see the seeds of revival sown in a culture which is becoming increasingly more [[paganism|pagan]] each day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v6/i2/creationII.asp Ham, Ken. Creation Evangelism] (Part II of Relevance of Creation). ''Creation Magazine &lt;nowiki&gt;'6'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(2):17, November 1983. &lt;/ref&gt;  Ham teaches that a rejection of the [[Creation according to Genesis|biblical]] creation history undermines the relevancy of the Christian [[gospel]]s and derivatively weakens the [[morality|moral]] foundations of society.

== Disputes relating to science ==

Many [[creationists]] vehemently oppose certain [[scientific theories]] in a number of ways, including opposition to specific applications of scientific processes, accusations of [[bias]] within the [[scientific community]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|1993|p=69}} where Johnson cites three pages spent in Issac Asimov's ''New Guide to Science'' that take creationists to task, while only spending one half page on evidence of [[evolution]].&lt;/ref&gt; and claims that discussions within the scientific community reveal or imply a crisis. In response to perceived crises in [[modern science]], creationists claim to have an alternative, typically based on [[faith]], [[creation science]], and/or [[intelligent design]]. The scientific community has responded by pointing out that their conversations are frequently misrepresented (e.g. by [[quote mining]]) in order to create the impression of a deeper controversy or crisis, and that the creationists' alternatives are generally [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].

=== Biology ===
[[Image:Phylogenetic tree.svg|thumb|340px|A [[phylogenetic tree]] based on rRNA genes.]]

Disputes relating to [[evolutionary biology]] are central to the controversy between Creationists and the [[scientific community]]. The aspects of evolutionary biology disputed include [[common descent]] (and particularly [[human evolution]] from common ancestors with other members of the [[Hominidae|Great Apes]]), [[macroevolution]], and the existence of [[transitional fossil]]s.

==== Common descent ====
{{main|Common descent}}
{{seealso|Evidence of common descent|Tree of life (science)}}

{{rquote|center|[The] Discovery [Institute] presents common descent as controversial exclusively within the animal kingdom, as it focuses on embryology, anatomy, and the fossil record to raise questions about them. In the real world of science, common descent of animals is completely noncontroversial; any controversy resides in the microbial world. There, researchers argued over a variety of topics, starting with the very beginning, namely the relationship among the three main branches of life.|John Timmer|''Evolution: what's the real controversy?''&lt;ref name=timmer&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/journals/science.ars/2008/05/07/evolution-whats-the-real-controversy Evolution: what's the real controversy?], John Timmer, Nobel Intent, May 07, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}
A group of [[organisms]] is said to have common descent if they have a common [[ancestor]]. A theory of universal common descent based on [[evolution]]ary principles was proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] and is now generally accepted by biologists. The [[last universal common ancestor]], that is, the [[most recent common ancestor]] of all currently living organisms, is believed to have appeared about [[Timeline of evolution|3.9 billion years ago]].
With a few exceptions (e.g. [[Michael Behe]]), the vast majority of Creationists reject this theory.

[[Evidence of common descent]] includes evidence from [[fossil record]]s, [[comparative anatomy]], [[biogeography|geographical distribution of species]], [[comparative physiology]] and [[comparative biochemistry]].

===== Human evolution =====
{{Wikibooks|Introduction to Paleoanthropology}}
{{main|Human evolution}}
{{seealso|Paleoanthropology|Adam and Eve}}

[[Human evolution]] is the part of biological evolution concerning the emergence of humans as a distinct [[species]].

Molecular evidence indicates that the lineage of [[gibbon]]s (family [[Hylobatidae]]) became distinct between 18 and 12 Ma, and that of [[orangutan]]s (subfamily Ponginae) at about 12 Ma; we have no fossils that clearly document the ancestry of gibbons, which may have originated in a so far unknown South East Asian hominid population, but fossil proto-orangutans may be represented by ''[[Ramapithecus]]'' from India and ''Griphopithecus'' from Turkey, dated to around 10 Ma. Molecular evidence further suggests that between 8 and 4 mya, first the [[gorilla]]s, and then the [[chimpanzee]] (genus ''Pan'') split off from the line leading to the humans; human DNA is 98.4&lt;ref name=&quot;98.4&quot;&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3744-chimps-are-human-gene-study-implies.html Chimps are human, gene study implies] New Scientist, website, May 19, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; percent identical to the DNA of chimpanzees. We have no fossil record, however, of either group of African great apes, possibly because bones do not fossilize in [[rain forest]] environments.

Thereafter, [[paleoanthropology]] traces human evolution, via [[fossil]] [[hominid]] evidence through [[Homo (genus)|genus Homo]] to [[Homo sapiens sapiens|modern Humans]].

Creationists have argued that these fossils are either of apes (e.g. that [[Java man]] was a [[gibbon]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/gibbon.html ''Was Java Man a gibbon?''], Jim Foley, [[TalkOrigins]] website, April 30, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;) or humans, with no intermediates between the two. However Creationists frequently disagree on where this gap lies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/compare.html ''Comparison of all skulls''], Jim Foley, [[TalkOrigins]] website, August 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creation myth]]s (such as the [[Book of Genesis]]) frequently posit a [[First man or woman|first man]] ([[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], in the case of Genesis) as an alternative viewpoint to the scientific account.

==== Macroevolution ====
{{main|Macroevolution}}
{{seealso|Speciation}}

Creationists have long argued against the possibility of Macroevolution. Macroevolution is defined by the scientific community to be [[evolution]] that occurs at or above the level of [[species]]. Under this definition, Macroevolution can be considered to be a fact, as evidenced by observed instances of [[speciation]]. Creationists however tend to apply a more restrictive, if vaguer, definition of Macroevolution, often relating to the emergence of new body forms or [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]]. The scientific community considers that there is strong evidence for even such more restrictive definitions, but the evidence for this is more complex.

Recent arguments against (such restrictive definitions of) macroevolution include the [[Intelligent design]] arguments of [[Irreducible complexity]] and [[Specified complexity]]. However, neither argument has been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, and both arguments have been rejected by the scientific community as [[pseudoscience]].

{{Expand-section|date=June 2008}}

==== Transitional fossils ====
{{main|Transitional fossil}}
{{seealso|List of transitional fossils|Bird evolution|Evolution of the horse}}

It is commonly stated by critics of evolution that there are no known transitional fossils.&lt;ref&gt;''Scientific Creationism'', [[Henry M. Morris]], 1985, pp. 78-90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Life--How Did It Get Here?'', [[Watchtower Bible and Tract Society]], 1985, pp. 57-59&lt;/ref&gt; This position is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of what represents a transitional feature. A common creationist argument is that no fossils are found with partially functional features. It is plausible, however, that a complex feature with one function can adapt a wholly different function through evolution. The precursor to, for example, a wing, might originally have only been meant for gliding, trapping flying prey, and/or mating display. Nowadays, wings can still have all of these functions, but they are also used in active flight. 

[[Image:Ambulocetus BW.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Reconstruction of ''[[Ambulocetus]] natans'']]

As another example, Alan Haywood stated in ''Creation and Evolution'' that &quot;Darwinists rarely mention the whale because it presents them with one of their most insoluble problems. They believe that somehow a whale must have evolved from an ordinary land-dwelling animal, which took to the sea and lost its legs ... A land mammal that was in the process of becoming a whale would fall between two stools—it would not be fitted for life on land or at sea, and would have no hope for survival.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Haywood, Alan (1985) ''Creation and Evolution''.Triangle Books, London. Quoted in ''[http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_leviathan.html Hooking Leviathan by Its Past]'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[evolution of whales]] has however been documented in considerable detail, with ''[[Ambulocetus]]'', described as looking like a three-metre long mammalian [[crocodile]], as one of the transitional fossils.

Although transitional fossils elucidate the evolutionary transition of one life-form to another, they only exemplify snapshots of this process. Due to the special circumstances required for preservation of living beings, only a very small percentage of all life-forms that ever have existed can be expected to be discovered. Thus, the transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, but it will never be known in detail. However, progressing research and discovery managed to fill in several gaps and continues to do so. Critics of evolution often cite this argument as being a convenient way to explain off the lack of 'snapshot' fossils that show crucial steps between species.

The theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]] developed by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] is often mistakenly drawn into the discussion of transitional fossils. This theory, however, pertains only to well-documented transitions within taxa or between closely related taxa over a geologically short period of time. These transitions, usually traceable in the same geological outcrop, often show small jumps in morphology between periods of morphological stability. To explain these jumps, Gould and Eldredge envisaged comparatively long periods of genetic stability separated by periods of rapid evolution.  For example the change from a creature the size of a mouse, to one the size of an elephant, could be accomplished over 60,000 years, with a rate of change too small to be noticed over any human lifetime.  60,000 years is too small a gap to be identified or identifiable in the fossil record.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

=== Geology ===
{{main|Flood Geology}}
{{seealso|Creation geophysics|Geochronology|Age of the Earth}}

Many believers in [[Young Earth Creationism]] – a position held by the majority of proponents of [[Flood Geology]] – accept biblical ''chronogenealogies'' (such as the [[Ussher chronology]] which in turn is based on the [[Masoretic]] version of the [[Genealogies of Genesis]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;AiG&quot;&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/tj/v17/i3/chronogenealogies.asp Biblical chronogenealogies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grisda.org/origins/07053.htm The Meaning of the Chronogenealogies of Genesis 5 and 11]&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that God created the universe approximately 6000 years ago, in the space of six days. Much of creation geology is devoted to debunking the dating methods used in [[anthropology]], [[geology]], and [[planetary science]] that give ages in conflict with the young Earth hypotheses. In particular, creationists dispute the reliability of [[radiometric dating]] and [[Isochron dating|isochron]] analysis, both of which are central to mainstream geological theories of the age of the Earth. They usually dispute these methods based on uncertainties concerning initial concentrations of individually considered species and the associated measurement uncertainties caused by [[diffusion]] of the parent and daughter isotopes. However, a full critique of the entire parameter-fitting analysis, which relies on dozens of radionuclei parent and daughter pairs, has not been done by creationists hoping to cast doubt on the technique.

The consensus of professional scientific organisations worldwide is that no scientific evidence contradicts the age of approximately 4.5 billion years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interacademies.net/Object.File/Master/6/150/Evolution%20statement.pdf ''IAP Statement on the Teaching of Evolution''], Interacademy Panel on Global Issues, June 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Young Earth creationists reject these ages on the grounds of what they regard as being tenuous and untestable assumptions in the methodology. Apparently inconsistent radiometric dates are often quoted to cast doubt on the utility and accuracy of the method. Mainstream proponents who get involved in this debate point out that dating methods only rely on the assumptions that the [[physical laws]] governing [[radioactive decay]] have not been violated since the sample was formed (harking back to Lyell's doctrine of [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]]). They also point out that the &quot;problems&quot; that creationists publicly mentioned can be shown to either not be problems at all, are issues with known contamination, or simply the result of incorrectly evaluating legitimate data.

Creationists do not claim to have a scientifically verifiable method for dating the Earth, and instead rely solely on Biblical chronologies.

=== Other sciences ===
==== Cosmology ====
{{seealso|Age of the universe}}

Whilst [[Young Earth Creationism|Young Earth Creationists]] believe that the [[Universe]] was created approximately 6000 years ago, the current scientific consensus is that it is about 13.7 billion years old. The recent science of [[nucleocosmochronology]] is extending the approaches used for [[Carbon-14]] dating to the dating of astronomical features.  For example based upon this emerging science, the Galactic thin disk of the Milky Way galaxy is estimated to have been formed between 8.3 ± 1.8 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=Del2005&gt;{{cite journal | author = Del Peloso, E.F. | coauthors = Da Silva, L.; De Mello, G.F.P.; Arany-prado, L.I. | year = 2005 | title = The age of the Galactic thin disk from Th/Eu nucleocosmochronology | journal = A&amp;A | volume = 434 | pages = 301–308 | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20047060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other creationists, including Old Earth Creationists, do not necessarily dispute these figures.

==== Nuclear physics ====
{{seealso|radiometric dating}}

Creationists point to experiments they have performed, which they claim demonstrate that 1.5 billion years of nuclear decay took place over a short period of time, from which they infer that &quot;billion-fold speed-ups of nuclear decay&quot; have occurred, a massive violation of the principle that [[Radioactive decay|radioisotope decay]] rates are constant, a core principle underlying [[nuclear physics]] generally, and [[radiometric dating]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=302 ''Nuclear Decay: Evidence For A Young World''], [[Russell Humphreys|D. Russell Humphreys]], Impact, Number 352, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific community points to numerous flaws in these experiments, to the fact that their results have not been accepted for publication by any peer-reviewed scientific journal, and to the fact that the creationist scientists conducting them were untrained in experimental [[geochronology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/helium/zircons.html ''Young-Earth Creationist Helium Diffusion &quot;Dates&quot; Fallacies Based on Bad Assumptions and Questionable Data''], Kevin R. Henke, [[TalkOrigins]] website, Original version: March 17, 2005, Revision: November 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gondwanaresearch.com/rate.htm ''R.A.T.E: More Faulty Creation Science from The Institute for Creation Research''], J. G. Meert, Gondwana Research, The Official Journal of the International Association for Gondwana, November 13, 2000 (updated February 6, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In refutation of young-Earth claims of inconstant decay rates affecting the reliability of radiometric dating, Roger C. Wiens, a physicist specialising in isotope dating states:
{{quotation|There are only three quite technical instances where a half-life changes, and these do not affect the dating methods [under discussion]&lt;ref&gt;Dating methods discussed were [[potassium-argon dating]], [[argon-argon dating]], [[rubidium-strontium dating]], [[samarium-neodymium dating]], lutetium-hafnium, [[rhenium-osmium dating]], and [[uranium-lead dating]].&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;:
#Only one technical exception occurs under terrestrial conditions, and this is not for an isotope used for dating. ... The artificially-produced isotope, beryllium-7 has been shown to change by up to 1.5%, depending on its chemical environment. ... [H]eavier atoms are even less subject to these minute changes, so the dates of rocks made by electron-capture decays would only be off by at most a few hundredths of a percent.
# ... Another case is material inside of stars, which is in a plasma state where electrons are not bound to atoms. In the extremely hot stellar environment, a completely different kind of decay can occur. 'Bound-state beta decay' occurs when the nucleus emits an electron into a bound electronic state close to the nucleus. ... All normal matter, such as everything on Earth, the Moon, meteorites, etc. has electrons in normal positions, so these instances never apply to rocks, or anything colder than several hundred thousand degrees. ...
#The last case also involves very fast-moving matter. It has been demonstrated by atomic clocks in very fast spacecraft. These atomic clocks slow down very slightly (only a second or so per year) as predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity. No rocks in our solar system are going fast enough to make a noticeable change in their dates. ...|Roger C.

=== Misrepresentations of science ===
==== Quote mining ====
{{main|Quote mining}}

As a means to criticise mainstream science, creationists have been known to quote, at length, scientists who ostensibly support the mainstream theories, but appear to acknowledge criticisms similar to those of creationists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobzhansky|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, almost universally these have been shown to be [[quote mining|quote mines]] that do not accurately reflect the evidence for evolution or the mainstream scientific community's opinion of it, or highly out-of-date.&lt;ref name=&quot;talk_origins_quote_mine&quot;&gt; {{harvnb|Pieret|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Meyer directs the center; former Reagan adviser Bruce Chapman heads the larger institute, with input from the Christian supply-sider and former American Spectator owner [[George Gilder]] (also a Discovery senior fellow). From this perch, the ID crowd has pushed a &quot;teach the controversy&quot; approach to evolution that closely influenced the Ohio State Board of Education's recently proposed science standards, which would require students to learn how scientists &quot;continue to investigate and critically analyze&quot; aspects of Darwin's theory.&quot; Chris Mooney.

Dembski]]&quot;The clarion call of the intelligent design movement is to &quot;teach the controversy.&quot; There is a very real controversy centering on how properly to account for biological complexity (cf. the ongoing events in Kansas), and it is a scientific controversy.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nick Matzke's analysis shows how teaching the controversy using the ''Critical Analysis of Evolution'' model lesson plan is a means of teaching all the intelligent design arguments without using the intelligent design label.[http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/07/no_one_here_but.html No one here but us Critical Analysis-ists...] Nick Matzke.

The effect of Defendants’ actions in adopting the curriculum change was to impose a religious view of biological origins into the biology course, in violation of the Establishment Clause.

This tactic is at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard. The goal of the IDM is not to encourage critical thought, but to foment a revolution which would supplant evolutionary theory with ID.&quot;[[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 89 of 139|Kitzmiller v.

[[George Mason University]] Biology Department introduced a course on the creation/evolution controversy, and apparently as students learn more about biology, they find objections to evolution less convincing, suggesting that “teaching the controversy” rightly as a separate elective course on philosophy or history of science, or &quot;politics of science and religion,&quot; would undermine creationists’ criticisms, and that the scientific community’s resistance to this approach was bad public relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/spp/dser/02_Events/Lectures/2006/02_Lecture_2006_0420.shtml AAAS Dialogue on Science, Ethics, and Religion], [[20 April]] [[2006]], Emmett Holman, Associate Professor of Philosophy from [[George Mason University]], retrieved [[2007-04-29]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom of speech ===

Creationists have claimed that preventing them from teaching [[Creationism]] violates their right of [[Freedom of speech]]. However court cases (such as [[Webster v. New Lenox School District]] and [[Bishop v. Aronov]]) have upheld school districts' and universities' right to restrict teaching to a specified curriculum.

=== Theological arguments ===
{{seealso|Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|Evolutionary argument against naturalism}}

{{Expand-section|date=June 2008}}

=== Religion and historical scientists ===

Creationists often argue that Christianity and literal belief in the Bible are either foundationally significant or directly responsible for scientific progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woods|2005|p=67-114}}, Chapter Five: The Church and Science&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, Institute for Creation Research founder [[Henry M. Morris]] has enumerated scientists such as [[Galileo Galilei|astronomer and philosopher Galileo]], mathematician and theoretical physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]], mathematician and philosopher [[Blaise Pascal]], geneticist monk [[Gregor Mendel]], and [[Isaac Newton]] as believers in a biblical creation narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument usually involves scientists either who were no longer alive when evolution was proposed or whose field of study didn't include evolution. The argument is generally rejected as specious by those who oppose creationism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114.html Index to Creationist Claims - Claim CA114] edited by Mark Isaak. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the scientists in question did some early work on the mechanisms of evolution, e.g., the [[Modern evolutionary synthesis]] combines [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] [[theory of evolution|Evolution]] with [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel's]] theories of inheritance and genetics.&lt;!-- Hopefully something so well known won't be viewed as original research. --&gt; Though biological evolution of some sort had become the primary mode of discussing speciation within science by the late-19th century, it was not until the mid-20th century that evolutionary theories stabilized into the [[Modern evolutionary synthesis|modern synthesis]]. Some of the historical scientists marshalled by creationists were dealing with quite different issues than any are engaged with today: [[Louis Pasteur]], for example, opposed the theory of [[spontaneous generation]] with [[biogenesis]], an advocacy some creationists describe as a critique on [[chemical evolution]] and [[abiogenesis]]. Pasteur accepted that some form of evolution had occurred and that the Earth was millions of years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA114_22.html Index to Creationist Claims - Claim CA114.22] edited by Mark Isaak. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religion and science|The relationship between science and religion]] was not portrayed in antagonistic terms until the late-19th century, and even then there have been many examples of the two being reconcilable for evolutionary scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/sci_rel.htm] Science and religion:
Conflicts &amp; occasional agreements&lt;/ref&gt; Many historical scientists wrote books explaining how pursuit of science was seen by them as fulfillment of spiritual duty in line with their religious beliefs. Even so, such professions of faith were not insurance against dogmatic opposition by certain religious people.

Some extensions to this creationist argument have included the incorrect suggestions that [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[deism]] was a tacit endorsement of creationism or that [[Charles Darwin]] [[Elizabeth Hope|converted on his deathbed and recanted evolutionary theory]].

== Forums for the controversy ==
=== Debates ===

Many creationists and scientists engage in frequent public debates regarding the origin of human life, hosted by a variety of institutions. However, some scientists disagree with this tactic, arguing that by openly debating supporters of supernatural origin explanations (creationism and intelligent design), scientists are lending credibility and unwarranted publicity to creationists, which could foster an inaccurate public perception and obscure the factual merits of the debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://richarddawkins.net/article,119,Why-I-Wont-Debate-Creationists,Richard-Dawkins ''Why I Won't Debate Creationists''], [[Richard Dawkins]], Reason : In the News, richarddawkins.net, the official Richard Dawkins website, Monday, May 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in May 2004 Dr. [[Michael Shermer]] debated creationist [[Kent Hovind]] in front of a predominately [[creationist]] audience. In Shermer's online reflection while he was explaining that he won the debate with intellectual and scientific evidence he felt it was &quot;not an intellectual exercise,&quot; but rather it was &quot;an [[emotional]] drama.&quot;{{Clarifyme|date=March 2008}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Hovind&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/04-05-10.html#miracle | title=Then a Miracle Occurs: An Obstreperous Evening with the Insouciant Kent Hovind, Young Earth Creationist and Defender of the Faith | publisher=[[Skeptic Magazine|eSkeptic Online]] | date=2004-05-10 | first=Michael | last=Shermer | accessdate = 2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While receiving positive responses from creationist observers, Shermer concluded &quot;Unless there is a subject that is truly debatable (evolution v. creation is not), with a format that is fair, in a forum that is balanced, it only serves to belittle both the [[Non-overlapping magisteria|magisterium]] of [[science]] and the magisterium of [[religion]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hovind&quot; /&gt; (see: [[scientific method]]). Others, like evolutionary biologist [[Massimo Pigliucci]], have debated Hovind, and have expressed surprise to hear Hovind try &quot;to convince the audience that evolutionists believe humans came from rocks&quot; and at Hovind's assertion that biologists believe humans &quot;evolved from bananas.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Pigliucci]]. ''[[Denying Evolution: Creationism, Scientism, and the Nature of Science]].'' (Sinauer, 2002): ISBN 0878936599 page 102.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Clarifyme|date=March 2008}}

[[Eugenie Scott]] of the [[National Center for Science Education]], a non-profit organization dedicated to defending the teaching of evolution in the public schools, claimed debates are not the sort of arena to promote science to creationists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hovind&quot; /&gt; Scott says that &quot;Evolution is not on trial in the world of science,&quot; and &quot;the topic of the discussion should not be the scientific legitimacy of evolution&quot; but rather should be on the lack of evidence in creationism. Similarly, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] took a public stance against appearing to give legitimacy to creationism by debating its proponents. He noted during a [[Caltech]] lecture in 1985:&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael. 'Why People Believe Weird Things', Owl Books, 2002. Paperback ed, p. 153. &lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Debate is an art form. It is about the winning of arguments. It is not about the discovery of truth. There are certain rules and procedures to debate that really have nothing to do with establishing fact — which creationists have mastered. Some of those rules are: never say anything positive about your own position because it can be attacked, but chip away at what appear to be the weaknesses in your opponent's position. They are good at that. I don't think I could beat the creationists at debate. I can tie them. But in courtrooms they are terrible, because in courtrooms you cannot give speeches. In a courtroom you have to answer direct questions about the positive status of your belief. We destroyed them in Arkansas. On the second day of the two-week trial we had our victory party!}}

=== Political lobbying ===
{{seealso|Politics of creationism|Kansas evolution hearings|Santorum Amendment|List of scientific societies rejecting intelligent design}}

A wide range of organisations, on both sides of the controversy, are involved in lobbying in an attempt to influence political decisions relating to the teaching of evolution, at a number of levels. These include the [[Discovery Institute]], the [[National Center for Science Education]], the [[National Science Teachers Association]], state [[:Category:Citizens Alliances for Science|Citizens Alliances for Science]], and numerous national science associations and state Academies of Science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/8408_statements_from_scientific_and_12_19_2002.asp Statements from Scientific and Scholarly Organizations], [[National Center for Science Education|NCSE]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand-section|date=June 2008}}

=== The controversy in the media ===

The controversy has been discussed in numerous newspaper articles, reports, [[Editorial|op-eds]] and letters to the editor, as well as a number of radio and television programmes (including the PBS series, [[Evolution (TV series)|''Evolution'']] and Coral Ridge Ministries' [[D. James Kennedy#Criticism and controversy|''Darwin's Deadly Legacy'']]). This has led some commentators to express a concern at what they see as a highly inaccurate and biased understanding of evolution among the general public. [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning journalist and writer [[Edward Humes]] states:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/columnists/guests/s_493631.html Unintelligent designs on Darwin], [[Edward Humes]], [[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|There are really two theories of evolution. There is the genuine scientific theory and there is the talk-radio pretend version, designed not to enlighten but to deceive and enrage.

The talk-radio version had a packed town hall up in arms at the &quot;Why Evolution Is Stupid&quot; lecture. In this version of the theory, scientists supposedly believe that all life is accidental, a random crash of molecules that magically produced flowers, horses and humans -- a scenario as unlikely as a tornado in a junkyard assembling a 747. Humans come from monkeys in this theory, just popping into existence one day. The evidence against Darwin is overwhelming, the purveyors of talk-radio evolution rail, yet scientists embrace his ideas because they want to promote atheism.}}

==The controversy outside the United States==

[[Image:Views on Evolution.svg|thumb|right|440px|Views on human evolution in other countries]]
While the controversy has been prominent in the United States, it has also flared up in other countries as well.&lt;ref name=Discover&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pitock |first=Todd |year=2007 |month=06 |title=Science and Islam |journal=Discover |volume= |issue= |pages=36–45}} &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=TBO&gt; {{cite news |author=Gregory Katz |title= Clash Over Creationism Is Evolving In Europe's Schools|url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2008/feb/16/na-clash-over-creationism-is-evolving-in-europes-s |publisher=Associated Press  |date= 2008-02-16|accessdate=2008-02-17}}/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NCSE Edis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/rncse_content/vol19/8371_cloning_creationism_in_turkey_12_30_1899.asp |title= Cloning Creationism in Turkey |accessdate=2008-02-17 |author=Taner Edis   |work=RNCSE 19 (6): 30-35 |publisher=National Center for Science Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic countries===

In recent times, the controversy has become more prominent in Islamic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Evolution and religion: In the beginning | work = | publisher = The Economist | date = 2007-04-19 | url = http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9036706 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-04-25 }}This article gives a worldwide overview of recent developments on the subject of the controversy.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, in [[Egypt]] evolution is taught in schools but [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Sudan]] have both banned the teaching of evolution in schools.&lt;ref name=Discover/&gt; Creation science has also been heavily promoted in [[Turkey]] and in immigrant communities in Western Europe, primarily by [[Harun Yahya]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NCSE Edis&quot;/&gt;

===Europe===

Europeans have often regarded the creation-evolution controversy as an American matter.&lt;ref name=TBO/&gt; However, in recent years the conflict has become an issue in a variety of countries including [[Germany]], [[The United Kingdom]], [[Italy]], [[the Netherlands]], [[Poland]] and [[Serbia]].&lt;ref name=TBO/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NCSE Edis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title=Serbia reverses Darwin suspension |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3642460.stm|publisher=BBC |date=2004-09-09 |accessdate=2008-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |author= Roger Highfield |title=Creationists rewrite natural history |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/earth/2007/10/02/scihist102.xml |publisher=The Telegraph  |date=2007-02-10 |accessdate=2008-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17th September 2007 the Committee on Culture, Science and Education of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe issued a report on the attempt by American inspired creationists to promote creationism in European schools.  It concludes &quot;If we are not careful, creationism could become a threat to human rights which are a key concern of the Council of Europe.... The war on the theory of evolution and on its proponents most often originates in forms of religious extremism which are closely allied to extreme right-wing political movements... some advocates of creationism are out to replace democracy by theocracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist 10 November 2007, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
With declining church attendance, there has been some growth in fundamentalist and pentecostal Christian denominations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/religion/stories/s820631.htm Christianity – Pentecostalism] [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the former [[Queensland]] state government of [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]], in 1980 lobbying was so successful that Queensland allowed the teaching of creationism as science to school children.  Public lectures have been given in rented rooms at Universities, by visiting American speakers, and speakers with doctorates purchased by mail from Florida sites.&lt;ref&gt;Plimer, Ian &quot;Telling lies for God- Reason versus Creationism&quot;, (Random House)&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most acrimonious aspects of the Australian debate was featured on the science television program ''[[Quantum (TV series)|Quantum]]'', about a long-running and ultimately unsuccessful court case by [[Ian Plimer]], Professor of Geology at [[Melbourne University]], against an ordained minister, Dr. Allen Roberts, who had claimed that there were remnants of [[Noah's Ark]] in eastern [[Turkey]].  Although the court found that Dr Roberts had made false and misleading claims, they were not made in the court of trade or commerce, so the case failed. &lt;ref name=&quot;QUANTUM&quot;&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/quantum/info/97lies.htm &quot;Telling Lies for God&quot;? - One Man's Crusade], accessed 2008-02-05, [[Quantum (TV series)|Quantum]].

'''{{global|date=January 2008}}
The term '''glass ceiling''' refers to situations where the advancement of a qualified person within the hierarchy of an organization is stopped at a lower level because of some form of discrimination, most commonly [[sexism]] or [[racism]], but since the term was coined, &quot;glass ceiling&quot; has also come to describe the limited advancement of the [[deaf]], [[blind]], [[disabled]], [[aged]] and [[sexual minorities]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;&quot;[http://www.breaktheglassceiling.com/history.htm History].&quot; Break the Glass Ceiling. 2008. Break the Glass Ceiling Foundation. 31 Mar 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation is referred to as a &quot;ceiling&quot; as there is a limitation blocking upward advancement, and  &quot;glass&quot; (transparent) because the limitation is not immediately apparent and is normally an unwritten and unofficial policy.  The &quot;glass ceiling&quot; is distinguished from formal barriers to advancement, such as education or experience requirements.

==History==
Sexual discrimination was outlawed in the United States through the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] in the hopes of allowing women to rise in the working world once proper experience has been achieved. 
 
The term &quot;glass ceiling&quot; has been thought to have first been used to refer to invisible barriers that impede the career advancement of women in the American workforce in an article by Carol Hymowitz and Timothy Schellhardt in the March 24, 1986 edition of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Baker &amp; Lightle, Cracks in the glass ceiling: An analysis of gender equity in the federal government auditing career field (2001), 18-26 [1]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term was used prior to that; for instance, it was utilized in a March 1984 ''Adweek'' article by Gay Bryant.

The term glass ceiling was used prior to the 1984 article by two women at [[Hewlett-Packard]] in 1979, Katherine Lawrence and Marianne Schreiber, to describe how while on the surface there seemed to be a clear path of promotion, but, in actuality, women seemed to hit a point where they seemed unable to progress beyond. Upon becoming CEO and chairwoman of the board of HP, [[Carly Fiorina]] proclaimed that there was no glass ceiling. After her term at HP, she called her earlier statement a &quot;[d]umb thing to say.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2006/10/19/carly_fiorina/ The truth about Carly | Salon Life&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States]] Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] used the term glass ceiling in her speech to endorse Senator [[Barack Obama]] for [[President]]: &quot;And although we weren't able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it's got about 18 million cracks in it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Post080608&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Anne E. Kornblut| authorlink=Anne E. Kornblut| title=Clinton Urges Backers to Look to November| journal=Washington Post| year=June 8, 2008| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/07/AR2008060702088_2.html?sid=ST2008060702571| pages=A01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term glass ceiling was originally specifically applied to discrimination against women.

== Types of glass ceiling barriers ==
* Paying ''differently'' for comparable work.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;
* Sexual, ethnic, racial, religious discrimination or harassment in the workplace
* Lack of family-friendly workplace policies

==Sexism and glass ceiling effects==
One of the major indicators that serve as an indicator that inequality exists between males and females is the gender gap. Currently women working full time are making approximately 77 cents for every dollar that males make. This is a marked improvement from the 1960s when women were making only 59 cent to the dollar for men.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, S.J. &amp; Hartmann, H.I. &quot;Still a man’s labor market: The long-term earnings gap.&quot; Washington DC:Institute for Women’s Policy Research, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Some explanations offered to explain this gender gap center around education. Women were believed to have such low earning power when compared to males two decades ago because, women were just entering the paid labor force and therefore, they possessed less skill and education than most men.&lt;ref&gt;The WAGE Project. What is the wage gap?. http://www.wageproject.org/content/gap/what.php. 15 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In turn the reason why this gap has greatly narrowed is due to the increase in education amongst women. McDonald and Thornton (2007) argue that when many factors such as promotions, job changes, and experience are controlled for much of the relationship between the wage gap, gender and educational attainment can be attributed to the types of majors men and women choose to pursue.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, J.A. &amp; Thornton, R. J. &quot;Do new male and female college graduates receive unequal pay?&quot; Journal of Human Resources, 42, 32-48, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that women just naturally gravitate to a field that earns less than male dominated fields. However, within female dominated fields (i.e., education) the “glass ceiling” is still present. Women often have great difficulty acquiring managerial positions within the school system, which is overwhelmingly female oriented.&lt;ref&gt;Moreau, M., Osgood, J., Halsall, A. Making sense of the glass ceiling in schools:  An exploration of women teachers’ discourses. Gender and Education, 19, 237-253, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, this phenomenon extends beyond choice of major and into all fields.

Although it is often down-played that any differences exist between men and women who are “climbing the ladder” together this is untrue. Unfortunately, the gendered inequalities are often embedded within the social hierarchy and this affects who is seen as the best fit for leadership roles. Different traits are assigned to females when compared to males. Males are seen as more competent and trustworthy as opposed to females.{{Fact|date=July 2008}} If a female does have other traits aside from the gendered traits that she is believed to possess then she is viewed negatively. &lt;ref&gt;Ridgeway, C.L.Gender, status, and leadership, Journal of Social Issues,57, 637–655, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a study conducted by Thomas-Hunt and Phillips (2004) they found that when women possessed expertise they were actually viewed as less influential by others. However, expertise was positive for males. Also, female led groups were less productive than male led groups even though the women held expertise in the area just like males. Therefore, possessing expertise is not viewed as positively as it is for males. This also suggests that lack of skills is not the only reason why women are not deemed worthy of leadership roles.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas-hunt, M.C., &amp; Phillips, K.W. When what you know is not enough: Expertise and gender dynamics in task groups, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 30, 1585-1598, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; 
Overall, the system is designed to cap the amount of promotions and knowledge women gain in comparison to males.{{Fact|date=July 2008}} In accordance with this notion of limited promotions Lyness and Heilman (2006) found that in a study conducted with 448 upper-level employees that women were less likely to be promoted than males, and if they were promoted they had stronger performance ratings than males. However, performance ratings were more strongly connected to promotions for women than men. This suggests that woman had to be highly impressive to be considered eligible for leadership roles, whereas this was not the case for men.&lt;ref&gt;Lyness, K.S. &amp; Heilman, M.E. When fit is fundamental: Performance evaluations and promotions of  upper-level female and male managers, Journal of Applied Psychology, 91, 777-785, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who quote the 77 cents on the dollar wage gap often ignore factors other than sexism. Women are more likely to choose jobs based on factors other than pay and are less likely to take jobs that require travel or relocation or jobs that are hazardous. On average, women take more time off and work fewer hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/02/AR2007040201262.html Carrie Lukas - A Bargain At 77 Cents To a Dollar - washingtonpost.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse glass ceiling ==
A new phenomenon, known as the &quot;reverse glass ceiling&quot;, has been taking shape in America over the past few years.  More and more men have started their careers in female-dominated industries, such as nursing, paralegal, travel and childcare.  Many have been discriminated against because of this. Some experts question whether it actually exists because it's{{clarifyme}} still infantile in growth.&lt;ref&gt;Merritt, Jennifer. &quot;[http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/departments/careertraining/?article=reverseglassceiling1 Does the &quot;Reverse Glass Ceiling Exist?]&quot; MSN Encarta. 31 Mar 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:glassceiling.jpg]] --&gt;
Some others call this concept the &quot;glass escalator&quot; and describe it as the rapid advancement of men into positions of authority within female-dominated occupations.&lt;ref&gt;''The Architecture of Inequality: Sex and Gender'' D. Newman and R. Smith 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations and related terms==
* '''Bamboo Ceiling''' - The exclusion of Asian-Americans from executive and managerial roles on the basis of subjective factors such as &quot;lack of leadership potential&quot; or &quot;inferior communication ability&quot; where the East Asian-American candidate has superior objective credentials such as Ivy League credentials (in comparison to their white counterparts with only state university credentials).  &lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2005/08/08/news/economy/annie/fortune_annie080805/index.htm Piercing the 'Bamboo Ceiling' - Aug. 8, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, research shows that there are a decent number of partners at leading prestigious law firms in the United States who did not attend top notch law schools.

==&quot;Glass ceiling&quot; in popular culture==
Canadian indie rock band [[Metric (band)|Metric]] wrote a song called &quot;Glass Ceiling&quot; on their [[2005]] album ''[[Live It Out]]'', which is a reference to this type of situation.

The effect has also inspired a musical, bearing the same name. &quot;Glass Ceiling&quot; ([[2006]]), written by Bret VandenBos and Alex Krall, examined and parodied the idiosyncrasies of both males and females in the corporate workplace.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Day173abfastg.JPG|thumb|right|Tourists of various nationalities chatting over breakfast at a B&amp;B in Quebec City.]]
'''Bed and breakfast''', also known as '''B&amp;B''', is a term, originating in the [[United Kingdom]], but now also used all over the world, for an establishment that offers accommodation and [[breakfast]], but usually does not offer other meals.  Typically, bed and breakfasts are private homes with only one or two bedrooms available for commercial use.
 
Other than a boarding house B&amp;B's are for people travelling through the area on short stays (not longer than one week)

==Overview==

Generally, guests are accommodated in private bedrooms with private bathrooms, or in a suite of rooms including an en suite bathroom.  Some homes have private bedrooms with a bathroom which is shared with another guests.  Breakfast is served in the bedroom, a dining room, or the host's kitchen.

B&amp;B's and guest houses may be operated either as a secondary source of income or a primary occupation. Usually the owners themselves prepare the breakfast and clean the room etc. , but you may find some bed and breakfasts where they hired staff for cleaning or cooking.  A property which hires professional management is no longer a bed and breakfast, but enters the category of Inn, Guest House or Small Hotel. B&amp;B's are a form of a tertiary business.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} 

==National differences==

===Australia===
Despite the cultural similarities, there are far fewer  B&amp;B's in the whole continent of [[Australia]] than there are in just the [[South Island]] of New Zealand despite the resident population being more than twenty times greater.&lt;ref&gt;Private Stay Accommodation Directory, &quot;[http://privatestay.com/search/Australia-0108.php Australia]&quot;, accessed [[4 April]] [[2007]] shows 43 pages for Australia as a country and a combined total of 51 pages for various regions of the South Island of &quot;[http://privatestay.com/search/New_Zealand-0114.php New Zealand]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1879 the average per capita disposable income of Australians has been greater than that of New Zealanders and this has mitigated the powerful incentive to let out rooms in their homes to travellers.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} Another factor may be that Australia has, apart from [[City states#Contemporary city-states|City States]] such as [[Singapore]], the greatest concentration of city dwellers anywhere on the globe and these cities are amply supplied with budget hotels and motels.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

===Belgium===
In [[Belgium]] bed and breakfasts generally offer better value than hotels, and provide the opportunity to sample the local food and meet new people. [http://www.bnb-brussels.be/guest.asp?LG=fr&amp;RO=3370001 Bed and breakfast accommodations] often have a very relaxing, homey feel to them. 

===Britain and Ireland===
B&amp;Bs, and frequently guest houses, are a budget option where owners often take pride in the high service levels, local knowledge and personal touch that they are able to offer.

There tend to be concentrations of B&amp;Bs in the seaside towns where, historically, the [[working classes]] holidayed such as [[Newcastle, County Down|Newcastle in Ireland]] and [[Blackpool#Tourism|Blackpool in England]], in isolated rural areas such as the [[Highlands of Scotland]] and [[Connemara]] where there is not a year-round concentration of travellers sufficient to sustain an hotel, and are present in most towns and cities in numbers dependent upon factors such as the level of tourism, York in England and Edinburgh in Scotland, for example, both have several hundred establishments known as either B&amp;B's or guest houses.

[[Breakfast]] is usually cooked on demand for the guest and usually features bacon, eggs, sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms and baked beans, but some offer a [[continental breakfast]]. 

In recent years some [[bed and breakfast]] businesses in the [[UK]] have struggled against budget hotel chains such as [[Premier Travel Inn]] and [[Travelodge]]. Traditionally, business travellers used B&amp;Bs but many of these clients now tend to stay in budget hotel chains. However, in holiday areas the B&amp;B and guest house still prevails. Unlike the 'chain' accommodation providers these provide a more comprehensive service and breakfast is included in the price.

===Cuba===
In [[Cuba]], which opened up to tourism in the 1990s after the financial support of the Soviet Union ended, a form of B&amp;B called ''[[casa particular]]'' (&quot;private home&quot;) became the main form of accommodation outside the tourist resorts.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

===Israel===
The Israeli B&amp;B is known as a ''zimmer'' (German for ''room''). All over the country, but especially in the north of the country and the Galilee, ''zimmers'' have become a popular alternative to hotels for romantic weekends or family vacations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=656508&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=10&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y There's gold in them thar hills ...]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kyrgyzstan===
[[Image:E8158-Tamchy-guesthouse.jpg|thumb|In the patio of a guest house in [[Tamchy]], Kyrgyzstan]]

B&amp;B industry is prospering in developing economies.

===New Zealand===
[[Image:Amber House, Nelson, New Zealand, 2005-11-16T01-33Z.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Nelson, New Zealand#Centre of New Zealand.3F|Centre of New Zealand]] Bed and Breakfast]]
As in the [[USA]], Bed and Breakfasts in New Zealand tend to be more expensive than [[Motel]]s and often feature historic homes and lovingly furnished bedrooms at a commensurate price.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} The historic city of [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] has an unusually high concentration of both of these accommodations and alternatives because it was historically the place where [[Kiwi (people)|kiwis]] holidayed.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

===North America===
Many B&amp;Bs in [[North America]] try to create a historical ambiance, with old properties turned into [[guesthouse]]s decorated with antique furniture.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} For example, the [[Holladay House]] in Orange, Virginia is an 1830s Federal-style brick building that has been converted into a bed and breakfast.  Recently, B&amp;B and Inn owners have been launching upscale amenities to improve business and move &quot;up-market.&quot; It is not uncommon now to find free wireless Internet access, free parking, spa services, or nightly wine and cheese hours. Due to the need to stay competitive with the rest of the lodging industry, larger bed and breakfast inns have expanded to offer [[wedding]] services, business conference facilities, and meeting spaces as well as many other services a large hotel might offer.

The custom of opening one’s home to travellers dates back the earliest day of Colonial America. Lodgings were few and far between in the 1700s, and apart from a limited number of coaching inns (a few of which survive as inns today), wayfarers relied on the kindness of strangers to provide a bed for the night.  Hotels became more common with the advent of the railroad, and later, the automobile, and most towns had at least one prominent hotel.

During the Great Depression, tourist homes provided an economic advantage to both the traveller and the host. Driving through town (no Interstates then), travellers stopped at houses with signs reading Tourists or Guests, indicating that travellers could rent a room for the night for about $2. The money generated needed income for the home owner and saved money for the traveller. 

After World War II, middle-class Americans began traveling in Europe in large numbers, many experiencing the European-style B&amp;Bs  (Zimmer frei in Germany, chambres d’hotes in France) for the first time. Some were inspired to open B&amp;Bs in the U.S.; tourist home owners updated their properties as B&amp;Bs.  The interest in B&amp;Bs coincided with an increasing interest in historic preservation, spurred by the U.S. Bicentennial in 1976 and assisted by two crucial pieces of legislation: the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, and the Tax Reform Act of 1976, which provided tax incentives for the restoration and reuse of historic structures. 

Through the 1980s and 1990s, B&amp;Bs increased rapidly in numbers and evolved from homestay B&amp;Bs with shared baths and a simple furnishings to beautifully renovated historic mansions with luxurious décor and amenities. The next big change started in the mid 1990s when the Internet became a major marketing force, making it affordable for innkeepers to promote their properties worldwide.  At present, travellers research and book B&amp;B online, checking out detailed photos, videos, and reviews.  B&amp;Bs are found in all states, in major cities and remote rural areas, occupying everything from modest cottages to opulent mansions, and in restored structures from schools to cabooses to churches.

== Regulations ==

Regulations and laws vary considerably in each national jurisdiction both in content and extent and in enforcement.

The most common regulations B&amp;Bs must follow pertain to safety. They are usually required by local and national ordinances to have fire resistance, a sufficient fire escape plan in place, and smoke detectors in each guest room. Kitchens and equipment used to serve meals are also often required to be monitored for hygienic operation, but there are significant national and local differences.

Most B&amp;Bs are generally compliant with their jurisdiction's laws.

In Hawaii, it is illegal to open a new bed &amp; breakfast on Oahu as of 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kokuacoalition.com/legislativeconceptsdoc.htm LEGISLATIVE CONCEPTS. REGULATION &amp; PERMITTING OF VACATION RENTALS &amp; B&amp;Bs on OAHU]&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the moratorium is to force home owners with extra room to rent out their extra space to low income residents who otherwise cannot afford housing on crowded Oahu.

==National associations== 

While various local governments have regulations and inspect for health issues and fire safety code, membership in a state/provincial/national bed and breakfast association can indicate a higher standard of hospitality. Associations sometimes review their members' properties and tend to have additional standards of care. 

These associations also facilitate marketing of the individual B&amp;Bs and provide a stamp of approval that the business in question is reputable. This &quot;stamp of approval&quot;, however, may be just an indication that membership dues have been paid. 

===USA===

There are six major on-line guides for Bed and Breakfast inns in the United States.
Accordingly to Innstar B&amp;B Guidebook Review, a rating service for Bed and Breakfast Guidebooks on the internet, reviews over 150 on-line Bed and Breakfast directories for travellers and innkeepers. The following 6 North American Bed and Breakfast Guidebooks have qualified for the top 5-Innstar rating: BedandBreakfast, [http://www.bnbfinder.com BnBFinder], [http://www.iloveinns.com iLoveInns], BBOnline, [http://www.bnbstar.com BnBStar], VirtualCities.

Two for-profit professional ''innkeeper'' associations that operate in the United States are the Professional Association of Innkeepers International and Select Registry. Most states also have state associations. These associations are usually non-profit organizations.

The Professional Association of Innkeepers International (PAII) is a national for-profit organization with members in the U.S., Canada, and other countries. PAII currently holds annual trade conferences for education of innkeepers and prospective innkeepers. Attendance to these conferences is open and well advertised to all. PAII also provides an industry study to all of its members at low cost that details operations and finance of the industry.

Such organizations as AAA and Mobil provide periodical inspections of B&amp;B inns. In addition, significant number of State and local B&amp;B associations offer inspection services to innkeepers. InspectedInns.org [http://www.inspectedinns.org/associations.asp] lists inspecting associations in the US.


Select Registry is a ''national'' organization that inspects its member properties on a regular basis, beyond routine inspections that may be carried out by the local government.[http://www.selectregistry.com/about.aspx]

The Caucus of American Innkeepers (or CAIK) is a social and professional networking organization for owners of B&amp;Bs, country inns, and similar properties.

The Bettina Network, is a national network of private homes which accept bed and breakfast guests. All homes are thoroughly checked out by someone from the Network spending the night in the home.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}  The network handles all aspects of the room (pricing, advertising, reservations, payment collection etc).  Questionnaires are sent to each guest to insure the satisfaction of all who use the service.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

In the US, states also have innkeeping associations that are usually non-profit and exist to promote the industry and state tourism. However, many state associations, such as the Bed and Breakfast Association of Virginia [http://www.innvirginia.com (BBAV)] have rigorous inspection criteria that often exceed government requirements for safety and cleanliness.

'''Airport security''' refers to the techniques and methods used in protecting [[airport]]s and by extension [[aircraft]] from [[crime]] and [[terrorism]]. 

Large numbers of people pass through airports every day. Such a large gathering of people presents a natural target for terrorism and other forms of crime due to the number of people located in a small area.  Similarly, the high concentration of people on large [[airliner]]s, the potential high lethality rate of attacks on aircraft, and the ability to use a hijacked airplane as a lethal weapon provide an alluring target for terrorism.

Airport security arguably provides a first line of defense by attempting to stop would-be attackers from bringing weapons or bombs into the airport.  If they can succeed in this, then the chances of these devices getting on to aircraft are greatly reduced.  As such, airport security serves two purposes: To protect the airport from attacks and crime and to protect the aircraft from attack. 

Monte R. Belger of the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] notes &quot;The goal of aviation security is to prevent harm to aircraft, passengers, and crew, as well as support [[national security]] and [[counter-terrorism]] policy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwar.org.uk/comsec/resources/senate-biometrics/te111401st-belger.htm|title=STATEMENT OF MONTE R. BELGER, ACTING DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR OF THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SUBCOMMITTEE ON TECHNOLOGY, TERRORISM, AND GOVERNMENT INFORMATION, ON SECURITY TECHNOLOGY, UNITED STATES SENATE, NOVEMBER 14, 2001. |accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Airport enforcement authority==
While some countries may have uniform protection at all of their airports, in other countries like the [[United States]], the protection is controlled at the state or local level.  The primary personnel will vary and can include:
*A [[police]] force hired and dedicated to the airport
*A branch ([[police substation|substation]]) of the local police department stationed at the airport
*Members of the local police department assigned to the airport as their normal patrol area
*Members of a country's military
*Members of a country's airport protection service
*[[Police dog]] services for [[explosive detection]], [[recreational drug use|drug]] detection and other purposes

When additional personnel are required, then several of the groups listed above can be used and as required supplemented by other resources that include:
*Officers from the normal agency, but in larger numbers using personnel not normally assigned to the airport
*[[Security guards]]
*[[Paramilitary]] forces
*[[Military]] forces

==Process and equipment==
[[Image:Backscatter x-ray image woman.jpg|thumb|right|An image of Susan Hallowell, Director of the Transportation Security Administration's research lab, taken with backscatter X-ray system, used for airport security passenger screening]]
Many past tragedies were the result of travellers being permitted to carry either [[weapon]]s or items that could be used as weapons on board [[aircraft]] so that they could [[Aircraft hijacking|hijack]] the plane. Travellers are quickly screened by a ''[[metal detector]]''. More advanced [[explosive detection]] machines are being used in screening. Passengers must be screened to discourage the carrying of [[bomb]]s aboard an aircraft. [[X-ray machine]]s are often used to speed up this process. Explosive detection machines can also be used for both carry on and checked baggage. These detect volatile compounds given off from explosives using a kind of gas [[chromatography]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/tip/INPHFA/vol-10/iss-3/p22.html The Industrial Physicist - Safeguarding ports with chemical profiling]&lt;/ref&gt;. A recent development is the use of [[backscatter X-ray]] scanners to detect hidden weapons and explosives on passengers. These devices, which use [[Compton scattering]], require that the passenger stand close to a flat panel and produce a high resolution image &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapiscansystems.com/sec1000.html Rapiscan Secure 1000]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Generally people are screened through airport security into the concourses, where the gates are all located.  This area is often called a secure or sterile area, and is referred to as [[airside]].  Passengers are discharged from airliners into the sterile area so that they usually will not have to be re-screened if disembarking from a domestic flight; however they are still subject to search at any time.  Eating establishments have started using plastic glasses and utensils as opposed to glasses made out of glass and utensils made out of metal to reduce the usefulness of such items as weapons.  Traditionally, non-passengers were allowed on the concourses to meet arriving friends or relatives at their gates, but this is greatly restricted now in the interest of security in the [[United States]]. Non-passengers must obtain a gate pass to enter the secure area of the airport.  The most common reasons that a non-passenger may obtain a gate pass is to assist children and the elderly as well as for attending business meetings that take place in the secure area of the airport.  In the United States, at least 24 hours notice is generally required for those planning to attend a business meeting inside the secure area of the airport.

In some countries, specially trained individuals may engage passengers in a conversation to detect threats rather than solely relying on equipment to find threats. In the United States the TSA has run several dummy tests in several major airports to measure the success of catching people with bombs. In 2002, the TSA reported that roughly 60% of fake bombs or component parts to bombs were missed by covert screeners. In 2007, that percentage rose to 75%, although this statistic alone is misleading&lt;ref&gt;The USA Today, October 18, 2007.  Note should be taken that 2002 tests had bomb parts in otherwise empty bags while recent tests involve small bomb parts packed into camouflaging materials in normally packed bags, such as toiletry kits.&lt;/ref&gt;. The tests are done by using undercover agents to carry fake bombs/parts in their carry on luggage and counting how many are successful with getting through security checkpoints. The TSA runs covert tests every day and when a screener misses an undercover agent carrying dangerous items, they are immediately sent to remedial training. Throughout the world, there have been a few dozen airports that have instituted a version of a &quot;trusted traveller program&quot;. Proponents argue that security screening can be made more efficient by detecting the people that are threats, and then searching them. Searching trusted, verified individuals should not take the amount of time it currently does and biometrics will help to solve this problem. {{Fact|date=October 2007}}

==Notable incidents==
The single deadliest airline catastrophe resulting from the failure of airport security to detect an onboard bomb was [[Air India Flight 182]] in 1985, which killed 329 people.

Another notable failure was the 1994 bombing of [[Philippine Airlines]] [[Philippine Airlines Flight 434|Flight 434]], which turned out to be a test run for a planned [[terrorism|terrorist]] attack called [[Operation Bojinka]]. The explosion was small, killing one person, and the plane made an emergency landing. Operation Bojinka was discovered and foiled by [[Manila]] police in 1995.

On [[May 30]], [[1972]] three members of the [[Japanese Red Army]] undertook a terrorist attack, popularly called the [[Lod Airport massacre]], at the Lod Airport, now known as the [[Ben Gurion International Airport]], in [[Tel Aviv]]. Firing indiscriminately with [[automatic firearm]]s and throwing [[grenade]]s, they managed to kill 24 people and injure 78 others before being neutralized (one of them through suicide). One of the three terrorists, [[Kozo Okamoto]], survived the incident.

The [[Rome and Vienna airport attacks]] in December 1985 were two more instances of airport security failures. The attacks left 20 people dead when gunmen threw grenades and opened fire on travelers at [[El Al]] airline ticket counters.

On [[August 10]], [[2006]], security at airports in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]] was raised significantly due to the uncovering by British authorities of [[2006 transatlantic aircraft plot|a terror plot aimed at detonating liquid explosives]] on flights originating from these countries. This is also notable as it was the first time the US Terror Alert Level ever reached Red. The incident also led to tighter restrictions on carrying liquids and gels in hand luggage in the [[European Union|EU]], [[Canada]], and the [[United Sates]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;1546/2006&quot;&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006R1546:EN:HTML Commission Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006 of 4 October 2006 amending Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 laying down measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation security Text with EEA relevance]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airport security by country==
===Canada===
All restrictions involving airport security are determined by [[Transport Canada]] and are enforced by the [[Canadian Air Transport Security Authority]] (CATSA).  Since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], as well as the [[Air India bombing]] in 1985 and other incidents, airport security has tightened in [[Canada]] in order to prevent any attacks in Canadian Airspace.

[[CATSA]] uses x-ray machines to verify the contents of all carry-ons as well as metal detectors, [[explosive trace detection]] (EDT) equipment and random physical searches of passengers at the pre-board screening points. X-ray machines, [[CTX]] machines, high-resolution x-rays and EDTs are also used to scan checked bags. All checked baggage is always x-rayed at all major commercial airports.

[[CATSA]] also completed the first phase of its Restricted Area Identity Credential (RAIC) program in January 2007. This program replaces the old Airport Restricted Area Passes issued to airport employees after security checks by the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]], the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and [[Transport Canada]] with new cards (issued after the same checks are conducted) that contain biometric information (fingerprints and iris scans) belonging to the person issued the RAIC.

The RAIC has yet to be extended to the security perimeter of Canadian airports for vehicles and persons entering from checkpoints not within airport terminals.

While [[CATSA]] is responsible for pre-board passenger and random non-passenger screening, they contract out to third-party &quot;service providers&quot; such as [[Aeroguard]] and [[Garda]] to train, manage and employ the screening officers. In addition, individual airport authroties which were privatized in the 1990s by the Canadian Government are responsible for general airport security rather than CATSA and normally contract out to private companies and in the case of large airports, pay for a small contingent of local police officers to remain onsite as well.

===Hong Kong===
[[Image:ASU armed with MP5.jpg|thumb|left|An armed police officer at [[Hong Kong International Airport]]]]
The [[Hong Kong International Airport]] is secured by the [[Hong Kong Police Force]] and Aviation Security Company (AVSECO). Within the police force, the Airport District is responsible for the safety and security of the airport island. Airport Security Unit (ASU) members are deployed around the airport and are visibly armed with H&amp;K MP5 A3 [[Submachine Gun]]. The security of the restricted area is the responsibility of the police and AVSECO.

While the airport is under the control of the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong]] (AAHK), the security power has been delegated to the AVSECO staffs. All persons and baggages carried by them must be X-Rayed and checked at the security screening points of the AVSECO (with a few exceptions at the Tenant Restricted Area).

The Customs and Excise Department will check passengers and crews' luggage to discourage smuggling of drugs and contraband from entering Hong Kong. New regulations have been made similar to Europe as of April 2007, no liquids can be brought onto a plane which exceed 100ml.

===France===
French security has been stepped up since terrorist attacks in [[France]] in 1986. In response France established the [[Vigipirate]] program.  After a brief drop of the program it was reinstated in 1991.  The program involves using troops to reinforce local security. The program increases requirements in screenings and ID checks. Since 1996 security check-points have transferred from the Police Nationale/Gendarmerie de l'Air to private companies hired by the airport authorities.

===India===
India stepped up its airport security after the 1999 [[Indian Airlines Flight 814|Kandahar hijacking]]. The [[Central Industrial Security Force]], a paramilitary organisation is in charge of airport security under the regulatory frame work and insructions of the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security ( Ministry of Civil Aviation Security). CISF formed an Airport Security Group this security force is dedicated to protect Indian airports. Each and every airport has now been given an APSU (Airport Security Unit), a highly trained unit to counter unlawful interference with civil aviation, apart from the CISF every airline has a highly trained aviation security force which is a separate department.

Terrorist threats and narcotics are the main threats in Indian airports. Another problem that some airports face is the proliferation of slums around the airport boundaries in places like [[Mumbai]]. Before boarding an aeroplane, searching of [[Luggage#Hand luggage|hand luggage]] is likely.

===Singapore===
[[Image:Aetos 01.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Aetos Security Management Private Limited|Aetos auxiliary]] [[police officer]] outside the Departure Hall of Terminal 2, [[Singapore Changi Airport]]]]
Security for the country's two international passenger airports comes under the purview of the Airport Police Division of the [[Singapore Police Force]], although resources are concentrated at [[Singapore Changi Airport]] where scheduled passenger traffic dominate. [[Seletar Airport]], which specializes in handling non-scheduled and training flights, is seen as posing less of a security issue. Since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], and the naming of Changi Airport as a terrorism target by the [[Jemaah Islamiyah]], the airport's security has been stepped up. Roving patrol teams comprising of two soldiers and a police officer armed with machine guns patrol the terminals at random.

Assisting the state organizations, are the security services provided by the ground handlers, namely that of the [[Singapore Airport Terminal Services]]'s [[SATS Security Services]], and the [[Aetos Security Management Private Limited]], formed from a merger of the [[Changi International Airport Services]]'s airport security unit and that of other companies to become a single island-wide [[auxiliary police]] company. These officers man check-in counters to screen luggage, control movements into restricted areas, and so forth.

Since 2005, an upgrade in screening technology and rising security concerns led to all luggage-screening processes to be conducted behind closed-doors. Plans are also in place to install over 400 cameras around the airport to monitor passenger activity around the clock and to check on suspicious parcels and activity to discourage bomb attacks similar to the [[2005 Songkhla bombings]] in [[Southern Thailand]] where [[Hat Yai International Airport]] was targeted. Tenders to incorporate such a system were called in late September 2005 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/ra/news/stories/s1473762.htm Radio Australia - News - Singapore to install more security cameras at Changi airport]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Spain===
Airport security in Spain is provided by different police forces, as well as private security guards. The [[Policía Nacional]] provides general security as well as passport (in international airports) and documentation checking. In [[Catalonia]] and [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], the [[Mossos d'Esquadra]] and the [[Ertzaintza]], respectively, have replaced the Policía Nacional except for documentation functions. The [[Guardia Civil]] handles the security and customs checking, often aided by private security guards. Local police provide security and traffic control outside the airport building itself.

Safety measures are controlled by the state owned company [[Aena]], and are bound to [[European Commission]] Regulations, as in other European Union countries &lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!CELEXnumdoc&amp;lg=en&amp;numdoc=304R0068 Commission Regulation (EC) No 68/2004 of 15 January 2004 amending Commission Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 laying down measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation security]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;1546/2006&quot; /&gt;.

===United Kingdom===
The [[Department for Transport]] (DFT) is the heart of airport security in the United Kingdom. In September 2004, Along with the [[Home Office]], DFT started an initiative called the &quot;Multi Agency Threat and Risk Assessment&quot; (MATRA), which was initially piloted at five of the United Kingdom's major airports - [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[Birmingham International Airport (UK)|Birmingham]], [[Nottingham East Midlands Airport|East Midlands]], [[Newcastle Airport|Newcastle]] and [[Glasgow International Airport|Glasgow]]. Following successful trials, the scheme has now been rolled out across 44 airports.

[[Image:birmingham airport arrivals arp.jpg|thumb|right|Terminal 2 at [[Birmingham International Airport]], [[England]]. The row of concrete security barriers makes close approach by vehicles difficult.]] 

Since the September 11 attacks in [[New York]], the [[United Kingdom]] has been assessed as a high risk country due to its support of the [[United States]] both in its [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]].

From [[7 January]] [[2008]], travellers are no longer limited to a single piece of carry-on luggage at most of the UK's major airports&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UK Airports where the one bag restriction will no longer apply from 7 January 2008|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/transportforyou/airtravel/airportsecurity/cabinbaggage |publisher=Department for Transport}}&lt;/ref&gt;; however travellers are urged to check with their airlines for other baggage restrictions.

Currently, hand luggage is limited to bags that are no larger than 56 cm (22.0 in) tall, 45 cm (17.7in) wide, 25 cm (9.8 in) deep&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Airport Security|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/transportforyou/airtravel/airportsecurity/ |publisher=Department for Transport}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, there is generally a weight limit &amp;ndash; again, check with the airline. 

Passengers are not permitted to take any liquids over 100 ml past security, although liquids in larger containers purchased in the secure area are allowed on flights. Any liquids under 100 ml must be placed in  &quot;a single, transparent, re-sealable plastic bag (about the size of a small freezer bag), which itself must not exceed 1 litre in capacity (approximately 20cm x 20cm)&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Liquids and air travel - what are the requirements?|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/transportforyou/airtravel/airportsecurity/requirements |publisher=Department for Transport}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

All bags are screened via X-ray before being put on the plane. All passengers must walk through [[metal detector]]s. Human airport security has also been increased and people are highly likely to be searched. There are also the usual checks of [[passport]]s and boarding cards. On-line check-in is also now in use.

The UK is considering new methods of screening passengers to further improve airport security, such as advanced X-ray machines that provide a 360-degree view of a person, as well as &quot;see&quot; under clothes, right down to the skin and bones.

Various criticisms have been brought up about this method. The latest X-ray machines (Backscatters) are planned to be tested in several U.S. airports through 2005 and at [[London]]'s Heathrow Airport. Due to their accuracy in looking under someone's clothes &amp;mdash; [[genitalia]] have been displayed during tests, meaning it would be equal to that of a [[strip search]] &amp;mdash; they will have to be carried out by someone of the same sex in accordance with strict rules. It is unlikely that everyone going through an airport would be liable to such a search.

===United States===
[[Image:SeaTacTerminalSecurity.jpg|thumb|right|Airport security stations are [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]]]]
Prior to the 1970s American airports had minimal security arrangements to prevent [[aircraft hijacking]]s.  Measures were introduced starting in the late 1960s after several high-profile hijackings.  

[[Sky marshal]]s were introduced in 1970 but there were insufficient numbers to protect every flight and hijackings continued to take place. Consequently in late 1972, the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] required that all airlines begin screening passengers and their carry-on baggage by [[January 5]], [[1973]].  This screening was generally contracted to private [[security]] companies.  Private companies would bid on these contracts, with the lowest bid usually being the winning one.  The airline that had operational control of the departure concourse controlled by a given checkpoint would hold that contract.  Although an airline would control the operation of a checkpoint, oversight authority was held by the FAA.  C.F.R. Title 14 restrictions did not permit a relevant airport authority to exercise any oversight over checkpoint operations.

The [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] prompted even tougher [[airport security repercussions due to the September 11, 2001 attacks|regulations]], such as limiting the number of and types of items passengers could carry&lt;ref name=TSAlist&gt;*[http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/prohibited/permitted-prohibited-items.shtm TSA's List of Permitted and Prohibited Items]&lt;/ref&gt; on board aircraft and requiring increased screening for passengers who fail to present a government issued [[identity document|photo ID]].

The Aviation and Transportation Security Act generally required that by [[November 19]], [[2002]] all passenger screening must be conducted by Federal employees. As a result, passenger and baggage screening is now provided by the [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA), part of the [[Department of Homeland Security]]. Provisions to improve the technology for detecting explosives were included in the [[Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004]].

Noticing the demand for new technology in airport security, [[General Electric]] (GE) started to develop the Secure Registered Traveler System. The new system would use newly developed technology such as automated carry-on scanning, automatic biological pathogen detection, [[Millimeter Wave Scanner|millimeter-wave full body scanning]] and a quadruple resonance carpet that would detect threats in shoes without having to take them off. The SRT program also works with [[smartcard technology]] along with [[fingerprint technology]] to help verify passengers. The fingerprint scanner also detects for explosive material traces on the person's fingers. These new sophisticated technologies will help improve efficiency at airports, but will also provide a more detailed search that is less intrusive to the passengers. Millimeter waves are less harmful than the previous [[X-ray]]s, making millimeter-waves less harmful to the body.

With the increase in security screening, some airports were led to have extensive security lines. To alleviate some of the lines, airports created Premium lines for passengers traveling in First or Business Class, or those who were elite members of a particular airlines Frequent Flyer program.

The &quot;screening passengers by observation techniques&quot; (SPOT) program is currently operating at some U.S. airports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsa.gov/what_we_do/layers/spot/ &quot;screening passengers by observation techniques (SPOT)&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States incidents====

On [[February 27]], [[2006]], at the [[Will Rogers World Airport]] in Oklahoma City, in an airliner cargo area (accessible only to authorized personnel), threatening graffiti was found.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}&lt;ref&gt; {{Citation| first= | last=| coauthors=| contribution=Travel Vs.

On [[March 6]], [[2006]] at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York, an elderly man drove his car onto the runway through two security gates. He made it to an active runway where an Air France aircraft was preparing to land.  Although eventually apprehended, the man drove around for approximately 23 minutes before being stopped. On the same day a man made it on to the runway by running though a secure gate while it was being opened at [[Midway International Airport]] in Chicago. The man made it through one of the three perimeter entrances that did not have a camera, resulting  in four different runways being closed down. This incident led to 222 aviation security officers being retrained and a redesign of all perimeter gates.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} &lt;ref&gt; {{Citation| first= | last=| coauthors=| contribution=Travel Vs.

On [[March 11]], [[2006]], after four years of continuous security breaches and staffing problems news reports indicated that federal officials removed the head of security at [[Newark Liberty International Airport]].{{Fact|date=October 2007}} &lt;ref&gt; {{Citation| first= | last=| coauthors=| contribution=Travel Vs.

On [[March 31]], [[2006]], at [[Honolulu International Airport]] two baggage screeners pleaded guilty to stealing thousands of dollars in yen from outbound Japanese tourist luggage. According to prosecutors, the baggage screeners were part of a group of screeners who stole money from outgoing luggage and divided the money amongst the group.&lt;ref&gt; {{Citation| first= | last=| coauthors=| contribution=Travel Vs.

'''Grand Cayman''' is the largest of the three [[Cayman Islands]] at about 196&amp;nbsp;km² and contains the capital [[George Town, Cayman Islands|George Town]]. Towns on the island are referred to as &quot;districts&quot;.

The island is a high-lying reef of &quot;ironshore&quot; (limestone fringes with numerous marine fossils), with a highest elevation of roughly 24 metres above sea level. There is no natural fresh water ([[lake]]s, [[river]]s, etc) on the island, so any fresh water needs must be met by [[catchment]]s or [[desalination]] of seawater. The lack of rivers does however account for the exceptional clarity of the sea.

The island was devastated by [[Hurricane Ivan]] in 2004 from [[September 11]] to [[September 12]]. With [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5]] strength, Ivan passed within {{convert|30|mi|km}} of Grand Cayman, hitting it with winds over 180 mph (290 km/h) and gusts up to {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The island reported no more than a few deaths - none directly caused by the hurricane - but over 80% of the buildings were either damaged or completely destroyed. Ivan was the worst hurricane to hit the island in 86 years.

The eastern side of the island is somewhat undeveloped, while the western side of the island, which holds [[George Town, Cayman Islands|George Town]] and the airport, [[Owen Roberts International Airport]], is more developed. [[Fast food]] restaurants, night clubs and resorts can be found on the western side of the island. The eastern districts offer more restaurants specialising in native Caymanian cuisine.

==Tourism==
The economy depends mainly on tourism - GDP is approximately 50% tourist related. Grand Cayman claims many other tourism attractions other than Seven Mile Beach. Grand Cayman is particularly well known for spectacular [[diving]] and [[snorkeling]]. The island features many reefs and walls, some of which can be accessed by swimming from shore.
[[Image:Green Sea Turtles Grand Cayman.JPG|thumb|left|250px|1-2 year old Green [[Sea Turtle]]s in a petting tank at the Turtle farm.]]
The district of [[West Bay, Cayman Islands|West Bay]] features a [http://www.boatswainsbeach.ky/ turtle farm] . The majority of Green Sea Turtles are raised for their meat, the theory being that this eliminates consumption of wild animals. Some of the farmed turtles are released, and have good survival rates in the wild. The turtle farm also has several rare [[Blue iguana]]s and a [[caiman]] on display.

West Bay district is also home to a formation of limestone affectionately known to islanders as [[Hell, Grand Cayman|Hell]]. Merchandise &quot;from Hell&quot; can be purchased nearby.
[[Image:Stingray Ctiy, Grand Cayman.jpg|thumb|rino stololght|250px|Stingray City in Grand Cayman allows swimmers, snorkelers, and divers to swim and feed stingrays.]]
[[Stingray City, Grand Cayman|Stingray City]], located a short boat ride from the northern end of Grand Cayman, is a series of shallow sand bars where sting rays are found in abundance and visitors can feed, pet, and interact with the animals. The southern stingrays can grow to large sizes (100 cm or more in span) and are quite accustomed to being handled and fed. A trip from a local tour operator will usually include snorkelling in coral gardens before arriving at Stingray City.

In the southern district of [[Bodden Town]] is the historic house of [[Pedro St. James]], considered the birthplace of democracy in the Cayman Islands. It is also the oldest known existing stone structure on Grand Cayman, And Bodden Town was also the first Capital of Grand Cayman..
[[Image:Grand Cayman Blue Iguana.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Blue iguana|Grand Cayman Blue iguana]] is one of the rarest lizards in the world, found only in the Cayman Islands.]]
In the Eastern Districts of the island are the districts of Bodden Town, [[East End Grand Cayman|East End]] and North Side. In the centre of the island (in North Side district) is the [[Mastic Trail]], a hiking trail through old growth dry forests that used to cover the entire island. Plants and animals native to Grand Cayman, such as the Mastic Tree, Blue iguana, [[parrot|green parrot]], and [[agouti]], can be seen.

Grand Cayman is also the only island in the Caribbean to have an operational turtle farm.

==Transportation==
[[Owen Roberts International Airport]] serves Grand Cayman with flights within and outside of the Cayman Islands.

==Education==
[[Cayman Islands Education Department]] operates government schools.

Government high schools in Grand Cayman include:
* [[John Gray High School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.italic.ky/lv/johngray/school.nsf/HomePage/Welcome |title = Learning Village - John Gray High School |accessdate = 2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a special government school, [http://www.italic.ky/lv/light/school.nsf/HomePage/Welcome Lighthouse School], is on the island.

==Athletics==
[[The Residences at the Ritz-Carlton Grand Cayman Legends Championship]] is a professional [[tennis]] tournament held each year in Grand Cayman.

==Grand Cayman in fiction==
The island was featured in the book ''[[The Firm (novel)|The Firm]]'' by [[John Grisham]] and subsequently in the films ''[[The Firm (1993 film)|The Firm]]'' and more recently ''[[Haven (film)|Haven]]'' directed by Caymanian, [[Frank E. Flowers|Frankie Flowers Jnr.]], starring [[Orlando Bloom]].

'''Recreational diving''' or '''sport diving''' is a type of [[Underwater diving|diving]] that uses [[Scuba set|SCUBA equipment]] for the purpose of leisure and enjoyment.  In some diving circles, the term &quot;recreational diving&quot; is used in contradistinction to &quot;[[technical diving]]&quot;, a more demanding aspect of the sport which requires greater levels of training, experience and equipment.&lt;ref &lt;ref group=nb name=tech&gt;The distinction (if a distinction exists) between &quot;recreational diving&quot; and &quot;technical diving&quot; is a source of some debate within the diving community, but most major [[List of diver training organizations|diving training agencies]] recognise and broad distinction (see for example, [[Professional Association of Diving Instructors|PADI]] and [[Diving Science and Technology|DSAT]], and [[SCUBA Diving International|SDI]] and [[Technical Diving International|TDI]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spumstechpolicy&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gorman DF, Richardson D, Hamilton Jr RW, Elliott D |title=SPUMS Policy on technical recreational diving |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society journal |volume=26 |issue=3 |date=1996 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6302 |accessdate=2008-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Recreational scuba diving grew out of related activities such as [[Snorkeling|snorkel]]ling and [[Spearfishing|underwater hunting]].&lt;ref name=richardson1999&gt;{{cite journal |author=Richardson, D |title=A brief history of recreational diving in the United States |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society journal |volume=29 |issue=3 |date=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6019 |accessdate=2008-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time, recreational [[underwater]] excursions were limited by the amount of breath that could be held. However, the invention of the [[aqua-lung|aqualung]] in 1943 by [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] and its development over subsequent years led to a revolution in recreational diving.&lt;ref name=richardson1999/&gt; However, for much of the 1950s and early 1960s, recreational scuba diving was a sport limited to those who were able to afford or make their own kit, and prepared to undergo intensive training to use it.

As the sport became more popular, manufacturers became aware of the potential market, and equipment began to appear that was easy to use, affordable and reliable. Continued advances in SCUBA technology, such as [[buoyancy compensator]]s, modern [[diving regulator]]s, [[wet suit|wet]] or [[dry suit]]s, and [[dive computer]]s, increased the safety, comfort and convenience of the gear encouraging more people to train and use it.

Until the early 1950s, navies and other organizations performing [[professional diving]] were the only providers of diver training, but only for their own personnel and only using their own types of equipment. The first scuba diving school was created in France to train the owners of the Jacques Yves Cousteau and Emile Gagnan designed double hose scuba. The first school to teach the modern single hose scuba was started in 1953, in Melbourne, Australia, at the Melbourne City Baths. RAN Commander Batterham organized the school to assist the inventor of the single hose regulator, Ted Eldred. However, neither of these schools were international in nature. 

There were no training courses, in the modern sense, available to civilians who bought the first scuba equipment. Some of the first training started in 1953 [[Captain Trevor Hampton|Trevor Hampton]] created the first British diving school, the [[British Underwater Centre]] and 1954 when [[Los Angeles County]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Los Angeles County Underwater Instructors Association |url=http://www.lascuba.com/ |publisher=Los Angeles County Underwater Instructors Association |title=Los Angeles County Underwater Instructors Association Official Homepage |accessdate=2008-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; created an Underwater Instructor Certification Course. Early instruction increased in the form of amateur teaching within a club environment, as exemplified by organizations such as the Scottish Sub-Aqua Club and the [[British Sub Aqua Club]] from 1953, [[Los Angeles County]] from 1954 and the [[YMCA (diving organization)|YMCA]] from 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=YMCA Scuba |url=http://www.ymca.net/scuba/ |publisher=YMCA Scuba |title=YMCA Scuba Official Homepage |accessdate=2008-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional instruction started in 1959 when the non-profit [[NAUI|National Association of Underwater Instructors]] was formed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=NAUI |url=http://www.naui.org/ |title=NAUI Official Homepage |publisher=NAUI |accessdate=2008-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, which later effectively was split&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=divinghistory.com |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010415140300/http://www.divinghistory.com/historyofpadi.html |title=History of PADI |publisher=divinghistory.com via Archive.org |accessdate=2008-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, to form the for-profit [[PADI|Professional Association of Diving Instructors]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=PADI |url=http://www.padi.com/ |title=PADI Official Homepage |publisher=PADI |accessdate=2008-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diving today ==

Further developments in technology have reduced the cost of training and diving. Scuba-diving has become a popular leisure activity, and many diving locations have some form of dive shop presence that can offer air fills, equipment and training.  

In tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world, there is a large market in 'holiday divers'; people who train and dive while on holiday, but rarely dive close to home.

[[Technical diving]] and use of [[rebreather]]s are increasing, particularly in areas of the world where deeper [[wreck diving]] is the main underwater attraction. Generally, recreational diving depths are limited to a maximum of between 30 and 40 meters (100 and 130 feet), beyond which a variety of safety issues make it unsafe to dive using recreation diving equipment and practices, and specialized training and equipment for [[technical diving]] are needed.

== Standard equipment ==
{{main|Diving equipment}}
* [[Buoyancy compensator|Buoyancy Control Device]] (BCD)
* [[Diving regulator|Regulators]]
* [[Diving mask|Scuba Mask]] and [[Snorkel]];
* [[Swimfin|Scuba Fins]]
* [[Wet suit|Wet]] or [[Dry suit]]
* [[Diving weighting system|Weight belt]]
* [[Diving cylinder|Scuba tank]]s (usually 3,000 psi of clean air for aluminium tanks, or 2,250psi for steel tanks)

== Issues ==
{{weasel section}}
There are several recreational diving issues that are currently topics of discussion within the diving community.  They include:

===Training levels===

There is a certain amount of disquiet over the level of training and experience necessary to qualify as a diver. Under most entry-level programs ([[SCUBA Diving International|SDI]], [[PADI]], [[British Sub-Aqua Club|BSAC]], [[NAUI]], [[Scuba Schools International|SSI]], [[PDIC]] and [[CMAS]]) divers can complete a certification with as few as four 'open-water' dives. Such a qualification allows a diver to rent equipment, request air fills, and dive without any higher supervision, provided they do so with a [[Buddy system|buddy]]. Critics claim that four dives is too few to prepare new divers for such a level of responsibility, and that either the total should be raised or the certification qualified.  Certification agencies normally answer that they advise their students to dive within the envelope of their experience and training, and to seek to extend both through properly supervised (and frequently revenue-producing) programs, but in the 1980s, several of the Agencies with DEMA did collaborate to author ANSI Standard Z86.3 (1989), ''Minimum Course Content For Safe Scuba Diving'' which now serves to limit their potential liability from lawsuits on training adequacy issues by defining their training as the definition of ''Accepted Industry Practices''.

===Regular vs. leisure===

Some divers see a split beginning to emerge in recreational diving between regular recreational divers, who often dive in their home communities, and leisure divers, characterized as those who dive occasionally, normally when abroad on holiday and in more benign conditions. It is sometimes observed that there is a tension between the two, and that leisure divers are often inexperienced, either under-trained or over-qualified, and sustain only a minimal empathy with the underwater world.  The call is usually not that these divers be restrained from diving, but that they be encouraged to dive more regularly in their home communities so as to gain experience and support their local diving scene. However, as recreational diving has a very low accident and death rate, it is a commonly claimed view that current training requirements are adequate.


== Specialties ==

There are many [[diving activities]] which need further training than that provided by the initial courses:

* [[Altitude diving]] 
* [[Cave diving]]
* [[Deep diving]]
* [[Drift diving]]
* [[Free-diving]]
* [[Ice diving]]
* Identifying and surveying sea life and freshwater life: see [[marine biology]]
* [[Maritime archeology]] or [[Underwater archeology]]
* [[Night diving]] 
* [[Snorkeling]]
* [[Underwater navigation]]
* [[Underwater photography]]
* [[Underwater search and recovery]]
* [[Underwater videography]]
* [[Wreck diving]] 

Many [[diver training]] agencies such as [[ACUC]], [[BSAC]], [[CMAS]], [[IANTD]], [[NAUI]], [[PADI]], [[PDIC]], [[SCUBA Diving International|SDI]], [[Scuba Schools International|SSI]] and [[YMCA (diving organization)|YMCA]] offer training in these areas, as well as opportunities to move into professional instruction, [[technical diving]], [[commercial diving]] and others.

== Bodies of water for diving ==

Most bodies of water can be used as dive sites:

* [[Seas]] and [[Oceans]] - these consist of salt water and a huge variety of [[Flora (plants)|flora]] and [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]].
* [[Lakes]] - small lakes are often used for [[diver training]]. Large lakes have many features of seas including wrecks and a variety of marine life. Man-made lakes, such as [[clay pit]]s and [[gravel pit]]s, often have lower visibility.
* [[Caves]] - these are more adventurous and dangerous than normal diving. See [[cave diving]].
* [[Rivers]] - are often shallow, murky and have strong currents.
* [[quarry|Quarries]] - abandoned rock quarries are popular in inland areas for diver training as well as recreational diving. Rock quarries also have reasonable underwater visibility - there is often little mud or sand to create mid-water particles that cause low visibility. As they are not &quot;wild&quot; and usually privately owned, quarries often contain objects intentionally placed for divers to explore, such as sunken boats, automobiles, aircraft, and even structures like grain silos and gravel chutes.

== Dive site features ==

Many types of [[underwater]] feature make an interesting dive site, for example: 

[[Image:Coral reef locations.jpg|thumb|370px|[[NASA]] image [http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/coralreef_image.html] showing locations of significant [[coral reef]]s, which are often sought out by divers for their abundant, diverse life forms.]]

*Wildlife at the site. Popular examples are [[coral]], [[sea sponge|sponge]]s, [[fish]], [[sting ray]]s, [[mollusc]]s, [[cetacea]]ns, [[Pinniped|seal]]s, [[shark]]s and [[crustacean]]s.

* The Topography of the site. [[Coral reef]]s, drop offs (underwater [[cliff]]s), rock [[reef]]s, gullies and [[cave]]s can be spectacular. Deep dive sites mean divers must reduce the time they spend because more gas is breathed at depth and [[decompression sickness]] risks increase. Shallow regions can be investigated by [[snorkeling]].

* Historical or cultural items at the site. [[Ship wreck]]s and sunken [[aircraft]], apart from their historical value, form artificial [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] for marine fauna making them attractive dive sites.

* Underwater [[visibility]] varies widely. Poor visibility is caused by particles in the water, such as [[mud]], [[sand]] and [[sewage]]. Dive sites that are close to sources of these particles, such as human settlements and river estuaries, are more prone to poor visibility. Currents can stir up the particles. Diving close to the sediments on the seabed can result in the particles being kicked up by the divers fins. 

* Temperature. Warm water diving is comfortable and convenient. Although cold water is uncomfortable and can cause [[hypothermia]] it can be interesting because different species of underwater life thrive in cold conditions. Cold water means divers tend to prefer Dry suits with inner thermal clothing which offer greater thermal protection although require training and experience to use properly. 

* Currents. [[tide|Tidal current]]s can transport [[nutrient]]s to underwater wildlife increasing the variety and density of that life at the site. Currents can also be dangerous to divers as they can result in the diver being swept away from his or her surface support. Tidal currents that meet solid underwater vertical surfaces can cause strong up or down currents that are dangerous because they may cause the diver to lose [[buoyancy]] control risking [[barotrauma]].

'''Bipolar disorder''' is not a single disorder, but a category of [[mood disorders]] defined by the presence of one or more episodes of abnormally elevated mood, clinically referred to as [[mania]]. Individuals who experience manic episodes also commonly experience [[depressive]] episodes or symptoms, or [[mixed episodes]] in which features of both mania and depression are present at the same time. These episodes are normally separated by periods of normal mood, but in some patients, depression and mania may rapidly alternate, known as [[Bipolar disorder#Rapid cycling|rapid cycling]]. Extreme manic episodes can sometimes lead to [[psychotic]] symptoms such as [[delusions]] and [[hallucinations]]. The disorder has been subdivided into [[bipolar I]], [[bipolar II]], Bipolar NOS, and [[cyclothymia]] based on the type and severity of mood episodes experienced.

Also called '''bipolar affective mood disorder''' until recently, the current name is of fairly recent origin and refers to the cycling between high and low episodes; it has replaced the older term '''manic-depressive illness''' coined by [[Emil Kraepelin]] (1856&amp;ndash;1926) in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kraepelin.org/ International Kraepelin Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The new term is designed to avoid the [[social stigma]] associated with the conflation of &quot;manic&quot; and &quot;depression.&quot;

==Introduction==
The onset of symptoms generally occurs in young adulthood. Diagnosis is based on the person's self-reported experiences, as well as observed behavior. Episodes of abnormality are associated with distress and disruption, and a high risk of [[suicide]], especially during depressive episodes.&lt;ref&gt;

Studies suggest that [[genetics]], early environment, [[neurobiology]], and psychological and social processes are important contributory factors. Psychiatric research is focused on the role of neurobiology, but a clear organic cause has not been found. Bipolar disorder is usually treated with medications and/or counseling. The mainstay of medication are a number of drugs termed '[[mood stabilizer]]s', in particular [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]] and [[sodium valproate]]; these are chemically unrelated medications used to prevent relapses of further episodes. [[Antipsychotic]] medications, sometimes called [[neuroleptic]]s, in particular [[olanzapine]], are used to treat and prevent manic episodes. The benefits of using [[antidepressant]]s in depressive episodes is unclear. Depending on the jurisdiction, in serious cases in which there is a risk of harm to oneself or others [[involuntary commitment]] may be used; these cases generally involve severe manic episodes with dangerous behaviour or depressive episodes with suicidal ideation. 

Some studies have suggested a significant correlation between [[creativity]] and bipolar disorder. Though studies consistently show a positive correlation between the two, the exact nature of the relationship between the disorder and creativity is still relatively unclear.&lt;ref name=&quot;santosa2006&quot;&gt; Santosa et al.

&lt;/ref&gt; One study indicated than an increased striving for and attainment of goals and achievements corresponded with the onset of manic symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson SL. (2005) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=15642648 Mania and dysregulation in goal pursuit: a review.] ''Clin Psychol Rev.'' Feb;25(2):241&amp;ndash;62.&lt;/ref&gt;  While the disorder affects people differently, individuals with bipolar disorder tend to be much more outgoing and daring than individuals without bipolar disorder.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}  The disorder is also found in a large number of people involved in the [[arts]].  It is an ongoing question as to why many creative [[genius]]es had bipolar disorder.

==Course==
Bipolar disorder is often a cyclic condition with which people periodically exhibit elevated (manic) and depressive episodes. Most people will experience a number of episodes, averaging 0.4 to 0.7 a year with each lasting three to six months, although some will experience only a single mood episode.&lt;ref&gt;

''Rapid cycling'', defined as having four or more episodes per year, is found in a significant fraction of patients with bipolar disorder.  It has been associated with greater disability or a worse prognosis, due to the confusing changeability and difficulty in establishing a stable state.  Rapid cycling can be induced or made worse by [[antidepressant]]s, unless there is adjunctive treatment with a mood stabilizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpic.pitt.edu/stanley/1stbipconf/bipolar2.htm#trtref|title=Treatment of refractory and rapid-cycling bipolar disorder}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, GS, MD, et al (2007) [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/356/17/1711 Effectiveness of Adjunctive Antidepressant Treatment for Bipolar Depression] ''New England Journal of Medicine'', Volume 356:1711&amp;ndash;1722 (Abstract).&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of rapid cycling most frequently cited in the literature is that of Dunner and Fieve: at least four major depressive, manic, hypomanic or mixed episodes are required to have occurred during a 12-month period.&lt;ref&gt;

===Major depressive episode===
{{main|Major depressive episode}}
Signs and symptoms of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder include: persistent feelings of [[sadness]], [[anxiety]], [[guilt]], [[anger]], [[isolation]] and/or hopelessness, disturbances in [[sleep]] and [[appetite]], [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] and loss of interest in usually enjoyed activities, problems concentrating, [[loneliness]], self-loathing, apathy or indifference, [[depersonalization]], loss of interest in sexual activity, [[shyness]] or [[social anxiety]], [[irritability]], [[chronic pain]] (with or without a known cause), lack of motivation, and morbid/[[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayo-dsection2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bipolar-disorder/DS00356/DSECTION=2 |title=Bipolar Disorder: Signs and symptoms |publisher=Mayo Clinic |accessdate= |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In severe cases, the individual may become [[psychotic]], a condition also known as severe bipolar depression with psychotic features.

===Manic episode===
{{main|Manic episode}}
Mania is generally characterized by a distinct period of an elevated, expansive, or irritable mood state. People commonly experience an increase in energy and a decreased need for sleep. A person's speech may be pressured, with thoughts experienced as racing. Attention span is low and a person in a manic state may be easily distracted. Judgment may become impaired; sufferers may go on spending sprees or engage in behavior that is quite abnormal for them. They may indulge in substance abuse, particularly alcohol or other depressants, cocaine or other stimulants, or sleeping pills. Their behavior may become aggressive or intrusive. People may feel they have been &quot;chosen&quot;, are &quot;on a special mission&quot;, or other grandiose or delusional ideas. Sexual drive may increase. At more extreme phases, a person in a manic state can begin to experience [[psychosis]], or a break with reality, where thinking is affected along with mood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/bipolar-disorder/complete-publication.shtml#pub2 NIMH · Bipolar Disorder · Complete Publication&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Many people in a manic state experience severe [[anxiety]] and are very irritable (to the point of rage), while others are [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoric]] and grandiose.

In order to be diagnosed with mania according to DSM-IV a person must experience this state of elevated or irritable mood, as well as other symptoms, for at least one week, less if hospitalisation is required. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, &quot;A manic episode is diagnosed if elevated mood occurs with three or more of the other symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, for 1 week or longer. If the mood is irritable, four additional symptoms must be present.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/bipolar-disorder/complete-publication.shtml NIMH · Bipolar Disorder · Complete Publication&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypomanic episode===
{{main|Hypomanic episode}}
Hypomania is generally a less extreme state than mania, and people in the hypomanic phase generally experience fewer symptoms of mania than those in a full-blown manic episode. During an episode, one might feel an uncontrollable impulse to laugh at things he or she does not normally find funny. The duration is usually also shorter than in mania. This is often a very &quot;artistic&quot; state of the disorder, in which a flight of ideas, extremely clever thinking, and an increase in energy can occur.

===Mixed affective episode===
{{main|Mixed state (psychiatry)}}
In the context of bipolar disorder, a mixed state is a condition during which symptoms of [[mania]] and [[clinical depression]] occur simultaneously (for example, [[agitation (emotion)|agitation]], [[anxiety]], aggressiveness or belligerence, confusion, [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], impulsiveness, [[insomnia]], irritability, morbid and/or [[suicidal ideation]], [[panic]], [[paranoia]], persecutory delusions, pressured speech, [[racing thoughts]], restlessness, and [[Rage (emotion)|rage]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bipolar-disorder/DS00356/DSECTION=7 |title=Bipolar Disorder: Complications |accessdate= |format= |publisher=Mayo Clinic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is based on the self-reported experiences of the patient as well as abnormalities in behavior reported by family members, friends or co-workers, followed by secondary signs observed by a [[psychiatrist]], [[nurse]], [[social worker]], [[clinical psychologist]] or other clinician in a clinical assessment. There is a list of criteria that must be met for someone to be so diagnosed. These depend on both the presence and duration of certain signs and symptoms.

An initial assessment includes a comprehensive history and physical examination by a physician.  Although there are no biological tests which confirm bipolar disorder, tests are carried out to exclude medical illnesses which may rarely present with psychiatric symptoms.  These include blood tests measuring [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|TSH]] to exclude [[hypothyroidism|hypo-]] or [[hyperthyroidism]], [[Blood tests#Blood chemistry tests|basic electrolytes]] and serum [[calcium]] to rule out a metabolic disturbance, [[Complete blood count|full blood count]] including [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate|ESR]] to rule out a systemic infection or chronic disease, and [[serology]] to exclude [[syphilis]] or [[HIV]] infection; two commonly ordered investigations are [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] to exclude [[epilepsy]], and a [[Computed tomography|CT scan]] of the head to exclude brain lesions.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}  

There are several psychiatric illnesses which may present with similar symptoms; these include [[schizophrenia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pope HG |year=1983 |title=Distinguishing bipolar disorder from schizophrenia in clinical practice: guidelines and case reports |journal=Hospital and Community Psychiatry |volume=34|pages=322&amp;ndash;28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[schizoaffective disorder]], drug intoxication, brief drug-induced psychosis, [[schizophreniform disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder]].  Alternately, patients currently in a hypomanic or mixed affective episode may display symptoms resembling borderline personality disorder.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} 

The last is important as both diagnoses involve symptoms commonly known as &quot;mood swings&quot;. In bipolar disorder, the term refers to the cyclic episodes of elevated and depressed mood which generally last weeks or months (notwithstanding Rapid Cycling variant of greater than four episodes a year). The term in borderline personality refers to the marked [[Affective lability|lability]] and reactivity of mood, known as [[emotional dysregulation]], due to response to external psychosocial and intrapsychic stressors; these may arise or subside suddenly and dramatically and last for seconds, minutes, hours or days. A bipolar depression is generally more pervasive with sleep, appetite disturbance and nonreactive mood, whereas the mood in dysthymia of borderline personality remains markedly reactive and sleep disturbance not acute.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin &amp; Jamison. pp. 108&amp;ndash;110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder has been debated; some hold that the latter represents a subthreshold form of affective disorder,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Akiskal HS, Yerevanian BI, Davis GC, King D, Lemmi H |year=1985 |title=The nosologic status of borderline personality: Clinical and polysomnographic study |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=142 |pages=192&amp;ndash;198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gunderson JG, Elliott GR |year=1985 |title=The interface between borderline personality disorder and affective disorder |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=142 |pages=277&amp;ndash;288}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others maintain the distinctness, though noting they often coexist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McGlashan |first=TH | authorlink=Thomas McGlashan|year=1983 |title=The borderline syndrome:Is it a variant of schizophrenia or affective disorder? |journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry |volume=40 |pages=1319&amp;ndash;1323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Pope HG Jr, Jonas JM, Hudson JI, Cohen BM, Gunderson JG|year=1983 |title=The validity of DSM-III borderline personality disorder: A phenomenologic, family history, treatment response, and long term follow up study |journal= Arch Gen Psychiatry|volume=40 |pages=23&amp;ndash;30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific ''medical'' indication. These may include serum [[BSL]] if [[olanzapine]] has previously been prescribed, lithium or valproate level to check compliance or toxicity with those medications, renal or thyroid function if lithium has been previously prescribed and taken regularly. Assessment and treatment are usually done on an outpatient basis; admission to an inpatient facility is considered if there is a risk to oneself or others.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

The most widely used criteria for diagnosing bipolar disorder are from the American Psychiatric Association's [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], the current version being DSM-IV-TR, and the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization's]] [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]], currently the ICD-10. The latter criteria are typically used in European countries while the DSM criteria are used in the USA or the rest of the world, as well as prevailing in research studies.

Recent studies by John Kelsoe have linked bipolar disorder to genetic defects.  “…[M]utations in the G protein receptorhinase (GRK3) gene—which regulates sensitivity to brain neurotransmitters such as dopamine…”&lt;ref&gt;…”(“Role for gene in bipolar disorder.” The Lancet 22 June 2003: 2137.&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsoe’s genetic discovery seeks to provide alternative treatments for those with bipolar disease.  In 1997 a genome survey was completed and Kelsoe and colleges reported that, “results support the presence of a susceptibility locus for bipolar disorder on chromosome 22…These molecular data raise the possibility that common susceptibility genes may be involved.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/98/2/585 A genome survey indicates a possible susceptibility locus for bipolar disorder on chromosome 22 - Kelsoe et al. 98 (2): 585 - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diagnostic criteria and classification===

There is no clear consensus as to how many types of bipolar disorder exist.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In [[DSM-IV-TR]] and [[ICD-10]], bipolar disorder is conceptualized as a [[Bipolar spectrum|spectrum]] of disorders occurring on a continuum. The DSM-IV-TR lists four types of mood disorders which fit into the bipolar categories: [[Bipolar I]], Bipolar II, [[Cyclothymia]], and [[Bipolar Disorder NOS]] (Not Otherwise Specified).

====Bipolar I====
In [[Bipolar I disorder]], an individual has experienced one or more [[manic episodes]] with or without major depressive episodes. For a diagnosis of '''Bipolar I''' disorder according to the [[DSM-IV-TR]], there requires one or more manic or mixed episodes. A depressive episode is not required for the diagnosis of Bipolar I disorder but it frequently occurs.

====Bipolar II====
[[Bipolar II disorder]] is characterized by more [[hypomanic]] episodes rather than actual [[manic episodes]], as well as at least one [[major depressive episode]]. Hypomanic episodes usually do not go to the full extremes of mania (i.e. do not usually cause severe social or occupational impairment, and without [[psychosis]]), and this can make Bipolar II more difficult to diagnose, since the hypomanic episodes may simply appear as a period of successful high productivity and is reported less frequently than a distressing depression. For both disorders, there are a number of specifiers that indicate the presentation and course of the disorder, including &quot;chronic&quot;, &quot;rapid cycling&quot;, &quot;catatonic&quot; and &quot;melancholic&quot;.

====Cyclothymia====
[[Cyclothymia]] involves a presence or history of hypomanic episodes with periods of [[Clinical depression|depression]] that do not meet criteria for major depressive episodes. A diagnosis of [[cyclothymia|Cyclothymic Disorder]] requires the presence of numerous hypomanic episodes, intermingled with depressive episodes that do not meet ''full'' criteria for major depressive episodes. The main idea here is that there is a low-grade cycling of mood which appears to the observer as a personality trait, but interferes with functioning.

====Bipolar-NOS====
Bipolar Disorder Not Otherwise Specified is a catch-all diagnosis that is used to indicate bipolar illness that does not fit into the other diagnostic categories. If an individual clearly seems to be suffering from some type of bipolar disorder but does not meet the criteria for one of the subtypes above, he or she receives a diagnosis of '''Bipolar Disorder NOS''' (Not Otherwise Specified).

Although a patient will most likely be depressed when they first seek help,{{Fact|date=November 2007}} it is important to find out from the patient or the patient's family or friends if a manic or hypomanic episode has ever occurred. This will prevent misdiagnosis of Depressive Disorder and avoids the use of an antidepressant which may trigger a &quot;switch&quot; to hypomania or mania or induce rapid cycling. Recent screening tools such as [http://www.bipolarlab.com/hcl the Hypomanic Check List Questionnaire (HCL-32)] have been developed to assist the quite often difficult detection of Bipolar II disorders.

===Delay in diagnosis===
The behavioral manifestations of bipolar disorder are often not understood by patients nor recognized by mental health professionals, so diagnosis may sometimes be delayed for 10 years or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familyaware.org/expertprofiles/drghaemi4.asp|title=Bipolar Disorder: How long does it usually take for someone to be diagnosed for bipolar disorder?|author=S. Nassir Ghaemi|date=2001|accessdate = 2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; That treatment lag is apparently not decreasing, even though there is now increased public awareness of this mental health condition in popular magazines and health websites. Recent [[TV special]]s, for example the [[BBC]]'s ''The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/tv_and_radio/secretlife_index.shtml|title=The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive|publisher=BBC|date=2006|accessdate = 2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; MTV's ''[[True Life]]: I'm Bipolar'', talk shows, and public radio shows, and the greater willingness of public figures to discuss their own bipolar disorder, have focused on psychiatric conditions thereby further raising public awareness. Despite this increased focus, individuals are still commonly misdiagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Misdiagnosis of Bipolar Disorder|author=Roy H. Perlis|publication=American Journal of Managed Care|url=http://www.ajmc.com/Article.cfm?Menu=1&amp;ID=2969|date=2005|accessdate = 2007-02-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
{{main|Bipolar disorder in children}}
Children with bipolar disorder do not often meet the strict DSM-IV definition, tending to have rapid-cycling or mixed-cycling pattern.&lt;ref name=Kranowitz, C.S. &amp; Post, R., (1996)&gt;Kranowitz, C.S. &amp; Post, R., (1996). Ultra-rapid and ultradian cycling in bipolar affective illness. [[British Journal of Psychiatry]], 168, 314&amp;ndash;323.&lt;/ref&gt;  The incidence in this age group has been traditionally held to be very rare.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}  In September 2007, experts (from [[New York]], [[Maryland]] and [[Madrid]]) found that the number of [[United States|American]] [[children]] and [[adolescents]] treated for bipolar disorder increased 40-fold from 1994 to 2003, and it was increasing ever since.  They concluded that [[Physician|doctors]] had been more aggressively applying the [[diagnosis]] to children, and not that the incidence of the [[disorder]] had increased.  The study calculated the number of visits which increased, from 20,000 in 1994 to 800,000 in 2003, or 1% of the [[population]] under age 20.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/04/health/04psych.html?em&amp;ex=1189051200&amp;en=13c932cc4a338702&amp;ei=5087%0A New York Times, Bipolar Illness Soars as a Diagnosis for the Young]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moreno C, Laje G, Blanco C, Jiang H, Schmidt AB, Olfson M. (September 2007) &quot;National trends in the outpatient diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder in youth,&quot; ''Archives of General Psychiatry''. 64(9):1032&amp;ndash;9. PMID 17768268&lt;/ref&gt;

Often other psychiatric conditions are diagnosed in bipolar children. These other diagnoses may be concurrent problems, or they may be misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder. [[Clinical Depression|Depression]], [[ADHD]], [[Oppositional Defiant Disorder|ODD]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[Tourette syndrome]] are common [[comorbid]] conditions. Furthermore some children with histories of abuse or neglect may have Bipolar I Disorder.

===Other theoretical models===
Flux is the fundamental nature of bipolar disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbsalliance.org/site/PageServer?pagename=about_MDOverview Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance: About Mood Disorders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with the illness have continual changes in energy, [[mood]], thought, sleep, and activity. The [[diagnostic]] [[subtypes]] of bipolar disorder are thus static descriptions &amp;mdash; snapshots, perhaps &amp;mdash; of an illness in continual flux, with a great diversity of symptoms and varying degrees of severity. Individuals may stay in one subtype, or change into another, over the course of their illness (Goodwin &amp; Jamison, 1990). The DSM V, to be published in 2012, will likely include further and more accurate sub-typing (Akiskal and Ghaemi, 2006).

==Associated features==
Associated features are clinical phenomenon that often accompany the disorder, but are not part of the diagnostic criteria for the disorder.

===Cognitive impairment===
Recent studies have found that bipolar disorder involves certain [[cognitive deficit]]s or impairments, even in states of [[remission (medicine)|remission]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
  It is not known whether specific cognitive deficits are mood state dependent or disorder-specific features of bipolar disorder. Few studies have examined impairments throughout all the different mood states, and many studies show conflicting data compared to other studies on account of methodological differences. Furthermore, the presence of mixed mood states complicates the  identification of accurate cognitive models for this condition. Some use theories that conform to the cognitive  models for unipolar depression and others on theories that focus solely on physiological or biological aspects of mania. However, Deborah Yurgelun-Todd &lt;!--PhD--&gt; of [[McLean Hospital]] in [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]], [[Massachusetts]] has argued that some deficits should be included as a core feature of bipolar disorder. According to McIntyre et al. (2006), &lt;blockquote&gt;
Study results now press the point that neurocognitive deficits are a primary feature of BD; they are highly prevalent and persist in the absence of overt symptomatology. Although disparate neurocognitive abnormalities have been reported, disturbances in attention, [[visual memory]], and [[executive function]] are most consistently reported.&lt;ref name=cog_[[17 November]]&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roger S. McIntyre, MD, Joanna K. Soczynska, and Jakub Konarski|year=2006|title=Bipolar Disorder: Defining Remission and Selecting Treatment|journal=Psychiatric Times|cite= October 2006, Vol. XXIII, No. 11 | url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/article/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=193400986}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;  However, in the April&amp;ndash;June 2007 issue of the Journal of Psychiatric Research (41, 3&amp;ndash;4, 265&amp;ndash;272) Spanish researchers  (Selva et al.) reported that people with bipolar I who have a history of psychotic symptoms do not necessarily experience an increase in cognitive impairment. Some individuals diagnosed with bipolar I may experience only mood-congruent psychotic symptoms which may suggest a less severe prognosis, but this is by no means conclusive.

===Creativity===
{{main|Creativity and mental illness}}

A number of recent studies have observed a correlation between creativity and bipolar disorder,&lt;ref name=&quot;santosa2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rihmer2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nowakowska2006&quot;/&gt; although it is unclear in which direction the cause lies, or whether both conditions are caused by a third unknown factor. Temperament has been hypothesized to be one such factor.

==Epidemiology==
Clinical depression and bipolar disorder are classified as separate illnesses. Some researchers increasingly view them as part of an overlapping spectrum that also includes anxiety and psychosis.

According to Hagop Akiskal, [[M.D.]], at the one end of the spectrum is bipolar type [[schizoaffective disorder]], and at the other end is [[unipolar depression]] (recurrent or not recurrent), with the anxiety disorders present across the spectrum. Also included in this view is [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]], [[postpartum depression]], and [[postpartum psychosis]]. This view helps to explain why many people who have the illness do not have first-degree relatives with clear-cut &quot;bipolar disorder&quot;, but who have family members with a history of these other disorders.

In a 2003 study, Hagop Akiskal M.D. and Lew Judd M.D. re-examined data from the landmark [[Epidemiologic]] [[Catchment]] Area study from two decades before.&lt;ref name=Judd_and_Akiskal_2003&gt;{{cite journal | first = Lewis L. | last = Judd | coauthors = Hagop S. Akiskal | month = January | year = 2003 | title = The prevalence and disability of bipolar spectrum disorders in the US population: re-analysis of the ECA database taking into account subthreshold cases | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 73 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 123&amp;ndash;131 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0327(02)00332-4|url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;list_uids=12507745&amp;dopt=ExternalLink}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original study found that 0.8 percent of the population surveyed had experienced a [[manic episode]] at least once (the diagnostic threshold for [[bipolar I]]) and 0.5 a [[hypomanic]] episode (the diagnostic threshold for bipolar II).

By tabulating survey responses to include sub-threshold diagnostic criteria, such as one or two symptoms over a short time-period, the authors arrived at an additional 5.1 percent of the population, adding up to a total of 6.4 percent of the entire population who can be thought of as having a bipolar spectrum disorder. This and similar recent studies have been interpreted by some prominent bipolar disorders researchers as evidence for a much higher [[prevalence]] of bipolar conditions in the general population than previously thought.

However these re-analyses should be interpreted cautiously because of substantive as well as methodological study limitations. Indeed, prevalence studies of bipolar disorder are carried out by lay interviewers (that is, not by expert [[clinician]]s/psychiatrists who are more costly to employ) who follow fully structured/fixed interview schemes; responses to single items from such interviews may suffer limited validity.

Furthermore, a well-known statistical problem arises when ascertaining disorders and conditions with a relatively low population prevalence or base-rate, such as bipolar disorder: even assuming that lay interviews diagnoses are highly accurate in terms of [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] and [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] and their corresponding area under the [[ROC curve]] (that is, [[Area under the curve|AUC]], or area under the [[receiver operating characteristic]] curve), a condition with a relatively low prevalence or base-rate is bound to yield high [[Type I and type II errors|false positive]] rates, which exceed [[Type I and type II errors|false negative]] rates; in such a circumstance a limited [[positive predictive value]], PPV, yields high [[false positive]] rates even in presence of a specificity which is very close to 100%.&lt;ref name=Baldessarini1993&gt;{{cite journal | first = Ross J. | last = Baldessarini | coauthors = Finklestein S., Arana G. W.| month = May | year = 1983 | title =The predictive power of diagnostic tests and the effect of prevalence of illness | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 569&amp;ndash;573 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;list_uids=6838334&amp;dopt=ExternalLink}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To simplify, it can be said that a very small error applied over a very large number of individuals (that is, those who are *not affected* by the condition in the general population during their lifetime; for example, over 95%) produces a relevant, non-negligible number of subjects who are incorrectly classified as having the condition or any other condition which is the object of a survey study: these subjects are the so-called false positives; such reasoning applies to the 'false positive' but not the 'false negative' problem where we have an error applied over a relatively very small number of individuals to begin with (that is, those who are *affected* by the condition in the general population; for example, less than 5%).
Hence, a very high percentage of subjects who seem to have a history of bipolar disorder at the interview are false positives for such a medical condition and apparently never suffered a fully [[clinical]] [[syndrome]] (that is, bipolar disorder type I): the population prevalence of bipolar disorder type I, which includes at least a lifetime manic episode, continues to be estimated at 1%.&lt;ref name=Soldani2005&gt;{{cite journal | first = Federico | last = Soldani | coauthors = Sullivan P.

A different but related problem in evaluating the public health significance of psychiatric conditions has been highlighted by [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] of [[Columbia University]]: fulfillment of [[diagnostic criteria]] and the resulting [[diagnosis]] do not necessarily imply need for treatment.&lt;ref name=Spitzer1998&gt;{{cite journal | first = Robert | last = Spitzer | month = Feb | year = 1998 | title = Diagnosis and need for treatment are not the same | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 120 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;list_uids=9477924&amp;dopt=ExternalLink | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.55.2.120 | pmid = 9477924}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, subjects who experience bipolar symptoms but not a full-blown, impairing bipolar syndrome should not be automatically considered as patients in need of treatment.

Recent studies have indicated that at least 50% of adult sufferers report manifestation of symptoms before the age of 17. Moreover, there is a growing consensus that bipolar disorder originates in childhood. In young children the illness is now referred to as [[pediatric]] bipolar disorder. Today about 0.5% of children under 18 are believed to have the condition. For children, the main concern is that bipolar disorder needs to be diagnosed correctly and treated properly because it can look like unipolar depression, [[ADHD]], or [[conduct disorder]]. Young children, [[adolescent]]s and [[adult]]s each express the condition differently according to child and adolescent bipolar disorders expert [http://www.bipolarchild.com/articles.html Demitri Papolos M.D.] and the [http://www.bpkids.org Child and Adolescent Bipolar Foundation]. There is, however, controversy about this last point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bipolar Disorder in Children and Adolescents: a Caution|url=http://www.psycheducation.org/depression/SoboOnKids.htm |accessdate= |format= |work= |publisher=psycheducation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bipolar disorder manifests in late life as well. Some individuals with &quot;hyperthymic&quot; temperament (or &quot;hypomanic&quot; [[personality style]]) who experience depression in later life appear to have a form of bipolar disorder. Much more needs to be elucidated about late-life bipolar disorder.

==Causes==
According to the U.S. government's [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH), &quot;There is no single cause for bipolar disorder — rather, many factors act together to produce the illness.&quot; &quot;Because bipolar disorder tends to run in families, researchers have been searching for specific [[gene]]s passed down through generations that may increase a person's chance of developing the illness.&quot; &quot;In addition, findings from gene research suggest that bipolar disorder, like other mental illnesses, does not occur because of a single gene.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/bipolar.cfm#bp5 |title=What Causes Bipolar Disorder? |accessdate= |format= |work= |author=NIMH}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Supporting the concept of genetic etiology was a study conducted by A. James Giannini and Andrew E. Slaby. Retrospectively reviewing the case histories of approximately 500 patients they described correlates with anatomical abnormalities.Bipolar patients had a significantly higher occurence of[[ mitral valve prolapse]] (MVP),[[ temporomandibular joint disease]] (TMJ), and [[scoliosis]].They hypothesized that genetic sites involved in bipolar  disorder were  in close proximity to genes related to TMJ, MVP and scoliosis. Although this work was conducted  on patients admitted to a general hospital in the years 1989-1990, it has not yet been replicated for verification. &lt;ref&gt; AJ Giannini, AE Slaby, JP Gianetti, MS Darosky, CB Wagomun, J Feather, DF Folts. Correlates on physical examination of bipolar patients. Turkish Journal of Biological and Medical Research. 2(1):23-29, 1991. &lt;/ref&gt;

It is well established that bipolar disorder is a genetically influenced condition which can respond very well to medication (Johnson &amp; Leahy, 2004; Miklowitz &amp; Goldstein, 1997; Frank, 2005).
(See [[treatment of bipolar disorder]] for a more detailed discussion of treatment.)

Psychological factors also play a strong role in both the [[psychopathology]] of the disorder and the [[psychotherapeutic]] factors aimed at alleviating core symptoms, recognizing episode triggers, reducing negative expressed emotion in relationships, recognizing [[prodromal]] symptoms before full-blown recurrence, and, practising the factors that lead to maintenance of [[remission (medicine)|remission]] (Lam et al, 1999; Johnson &amp; Leahy, 2004; Basco &amp; Rush, 2005; Miklowitz &amp; Goldstein, 1997; Frank, 2005). Modern [[evidence based medicine|evidence based]] psychotherapies designed specifically for bipolar disorder when used in combination with standard medication treatment increase the time the individual stays well significantly longer than medications alone (Frank, 2005). These psychotherapies are [[interpersonal and social rhythm therapy]] for bipolar disorder, family focused therapy for bipolar disorder, psychoeducation, [[cognitive therapy]] for bipolar disorder, and [[prodrome]] detection. All except psychoeducation and prodrome detection are available as books.

Abnormalities in brain function have been related to feelings of [[anxiety]] and lower stress resilience. When faced with a very stressful, negative major life event, such as a failure in an important area, an individual may have his first major depression. Conversely, when an individual accomplishes a major achievement he may experience his first [[hypomanic]] or [[manic]] episode. Individuals with bipolar disorder tend to experience episode triggers involving either [[interpersonal]] or achievement-related life events. An example of interpersonal-life events include [[falling in love]] or, conversely, the death of a close friend. Achievement-related life events include acceptance into an elite [[graduate school]] or by contrast, being fired from work (Miklowitz &amp; Goldstein, 1997). [[Childbirth]] can also trigger a [[postpartum psychosis]] for bipolar women, which can lead in the worst cases to [[infanticide]].

The &quot;kindling&quot; theory asserts that people who are genetically predisposed toward bipolar disorder can experience a series of stressful events,&lt;ref name=kindling&gt;[http://www.bpinfo.net/kindling_theory.htm Link and reference involving kindling theory]&lt;/ref&gt; each of which lowers the threshold at which mood changes occur. Eventually, a mood episode can start (and become recurrent) by itself. There is evidence of [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA axis) abnormalities in bipolar disorder due to [[stress]].&lt;ref&gt;Brian Koehler, Ph.D.,  The International Society for the Psychological Treatment Of Schizophrenia and Other Psychoses,   [http://www.isps-us.org/koehler/bipolar_stress.htm Bipolar Disorder, Stress, and the HPA Axis], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals experience subsequent mood episodes in the absence of positive or negative life events, however, which can be especially debilitating.

Individuals with late-[[adolescent]]/early [[adult]] onset of the disorder will very likely have experienced [[childhood]] anxiety and depression. Some argue that childhood-onset bipolar disorder should be treated when it occurs to prevent the full development of the disorder.

A [[family history (medicine)|family history]] of [[bipolar spectrum]] disorders can impart a genetic predisposition towards developing a bipolar spectrum disorder.&lt;ref name=Genetic_Likelihood&gt;[http://www.psycheducation.org/depression/risk.htm Genetics and Risk] PsychEducation.org&lt;/ref&gt; Since bipolar disorders are [[polygenic]] (involving many genes), there are apt to be many unipolar and bipolar disordered individuals in the same family pedigree. This is very often the case (Barondes, 1998). [[Anxiety disorders]], clinical depression, [[eating disorders]], [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]], [[postpartum depression]], [[postpartum psychosis]] [[schizoaffective disorder]] and/or [[schizophrenia]] may be part of the patient's family history and reflects a term called &quot;genetic loading&quot;.

Bipolar disorder is not either environmental or physiological, it is multifactorial; that is, many genes and [[environmental factors]] conspire to create the disorder (Johnson &amp; Leahy, 2004).

Since bipolar disorder is so [[heterogeneous]], it is likely that people experience different pathways towards the illness (Miklowitz &amp; Goldstein, 1997).

For example, recent research done in Japan hypothesizes that dysfunctional [[mitochondria]] in the brain may play a role (Stork &amp; Renshaw, 2005).

===Heritability or inheritance===
The disorder runs in families.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; More than two-thirds of people with bipolar disorder have at least one close relative with the disorder or with unipolar major depression.

Studies seeking to identify the genetic basis of bipolar disorder indicate that susceptibility stems from multiple genes. Scientists are continuing their search for these genes, using advanced genetic analytic methods and large samples of families affected by the illness. The researchers are hopeful that identification of susceptibility genes for bipolar disorder, and the brain proteins they code for, will make it possible to develop better treatments and preventive interventions targeted at the underlying illness process.

===Genetic research===
There is increasing evidence for a genetic component in the causation of bipolar disorder, provided by a number of [[twin studies]] and [[gene linkage]] studies.

The [[monozygotic]] [[Concordance (genetics)|concordance]] rate for the disorder is 70%. This means that if a person has the disorder, an identical twin has a 70% likelihood of having the disorder as well. [[Dizygotic]] twins have a 23% concordance rate. These concordance rates are not universally replicated in the literature; recent studies have shown rates of around 40% for monozygotic and less than 10% for dizygotic twins (see Kieseppa, 2004 and Cardno, 1999).&lt;ref name=Kieseppa_2004&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15465978&amp;query_hl=8&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum] Kieseppa T, Partonen T, Haukka J, Kaprio J, Lonnqvist J.

In 2003, a group of American and Canadian researchers published a paper that used [[gene linkage]] techniques to identify a [[mutation]] in the [[GRK3]] gene as a possible cause of up to 10% of cases of bipolar disorder.  This gene is associated with a [[kinase]] [[enzyme]] called G protein receptor kinase 3, which appears to be involved in [[dopamine]] [[metabolism]], and may provide a possible target for new drugs for bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name=Barr_2003&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barrett TB, Hauger RL, Kennedy JL, Sadovnick AD, Remick RA, Keck PE, McElroy SL, Alexander M, Shaw SH, Kelsoe JR. | month = May | year = 2003 | title = Evidence that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter of the G protein receptor kinase 3 gene is associated with bipolar disorder | journal = Molecular Psychiatry | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 546&amp;ndash;57 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mp.4001268 &lt;!--Retrieved from URL by DOI bot--&gt; | url = http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v8/n5/abs/4001268a.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 gene-linkage study by an international team coordinated by the [[NIMH]]
has identified a number of genes as likely to be involved in the etiology of bipolar disorder, suggesting that bipolar disorder may be a [[polygenic]] disease. The researchers at [[NIMH]] have found a correlation between DGKH (diacylglycerol kinase eta) and bipolar disorder.
The portion of the genome that encodes DGKH, a key protein in the lithium-sensitive phosphatidyl inositol pathway.&lt;ref&gt;

Bipolar disorder cannot be cured; instead, the emphasis of treatment is on effective management of acute episodes and prevention of further episodes by use of [[pharmacological]] and [[psychotherapeutic]] techniques.

Hospitalization may occur, especially with manic episodes. This can be voluntary or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntary (called civil or [[involuntary commitment]]). Long-term inpatient stays are now less common due to [[deinstitutionalization]], although can still occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeckerKilian2006&quot;&gt;Becker T, Kilian R. (2006) Psychiatric services for people with severe mental illness across western Europe: what can be generalized from current knowledge about differences in provision, costs and outcomes of mental health care? ''[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] Supplement'', 429, 9–16. PMID 16445476&lt;/ref&gt; Following (or in lieu of) a hospital admission, support services available can include drop-in centers, visits from members of a community mental health team or [[Assertive Community Treatment]] team, supported employment and patient-led support groups.&lt;ref&gt;McGurk, SR, Mueser KT, Feldman K, Wolfe R, Pascaris A (2007).

===Medication===
The mainstay of treatment is a mood stabilizer medication; these comprise several unrelated compounds which have been shown to be effective in preventing relapses of manic, or in the one case, depressive episodes.  The first known and &quot;gold standard&quot; mood stabilizer is [[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]],&lt;ref&gt;Poolsup N, Li Wan Po A, de Oliveira IR. (2000) Systematic overview of lithium treatment in acute mania. ''J Clin Pharm Ther'' '''25''': 139&amp;ndash;156 PMID: 10849192&lt;/ref&gt; while almost as widely used is [[sodium valproate]],&lt;ref name =&quot;Macr02&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Macritchie K, Geddes JR, Scott J, Haslam D, de Lima M, Goodwin G. | title = Valproate for acute mood episodes in bipolar disorder| journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = | issue = 2 | pages = | publisher = John Wiley and Sons, Ltd. | date= 2002 | url = http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab004052.html (abstract) | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004052| id = ISSN 1464-780X}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally used as an [[anticonvulsant]]. Other anticonvulsants used in bipolar disorder include [[carbamazepine]], reportedly more effective in rapid cycling bipolar disorder, and [[lamotrigine]], which is the first anticonvulsant shown to be of benefit in bipolar depression.&lt;ref&gt;Calabrese JR, Bowden CL, Sachs GS, Ascher JA, Monaghan E, Rudd GD.(1999) A double-blind placebo-controlled study of lamotrigine monotherapy in outpatients with bipolar I depression. Lamictal 602 Study Group. ''J Clin Psychiatry'' '''60''': 79&amp;ndash;88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment of the agitation in acute manic episodes has often required the use of [[antipsychotic]] medications, such as [[Quetiapine]], [[Olanzapine]] and [[Chlorpromazine]]. More recently, Olanzapine and Quetiapine have been approved as effective monotherapy for the maintenance of bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name=Olanzapine_maintenance_therapy&gt; [http://www.zyprexa.com/common_pages/hcp_maintenance.jsp Now Approved: ZYPREXA for maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder.] Official Zyprexa Website.&lt;/ref&gt; A head-to-head randomized control trial in 2005 has also shown olanzapine monotherapy to be as effective and safe as lithium in [[prophylaxis]].&lt;ref name=Tohen_et_al_2005&gt;{{cite journal | first = Mauricio | last = Tohen | coauthors = Waldemar Greil, Joseph R.

The use of antidepressants in bipolar disorder has been debated, with some studies reporting a worse outcome with their use triggering manic, hypomanic or mixed episodes, especially if no mood stabiliser is used. However, most mood stabilizers are of limited effectiveness in depressive episodes.

==Research==
{{main|Bipolar disorders research}}
The following studies are ongoing, and are recruiting volunteers:

[http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/twinstudy The Maudsley Bipolar Twin Study], based at the [[Institute of Psychiatry]] in [[London]] is conducting research about the genetic basis of bipolar disorder using twin methodology. Currently recruiting volunteers: identical and non-identical twins pairs, where either one or both twins has a diagnosis of bipolar I or II.

[http://www.bipolarlab.com/emonitoring The Maudsley Bipolar eMonitoring Project], another research study based at the [[Institute of Psychiatry]] in [[London]], is conducting novel research on electronic monitoring methodologies (electronic mood diaries and [[actigraphy]]) for tracking bipolar symptom fluctuations in Bipolar individuals who are interested in self-managing their condition. The study is currently recruiting volunteers from all over the world (see [http://www.bipolarlab.com/emonitoring/remote Remote eMonitoring])

===Medical imaging===
Researchers are using advanced brain imaging techniques to examine brain function and structure in people with bipolar disorder, particularly using the [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] and [[positron emission tomography]]. An important area of [[neuroimaging]] research focuses on identifying and characterizing networks of interconnected [[nerve cell]]s in the [[brain]], interactions among which form the basis for normal and abnormal behaviors. Researchers hypothesize that abnormalities in the structure and/or function of certain brain circuits could underlie bipolar and other mood disorders, and studies have found [[anatomical]] differences in areas such as the [[amygdala]],&lt;ref&gt;Strakowski, S.M., DelBello, M.P, Sax, K.W. et. al. (1999). &quot;[http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/56/3/254 Brain magnetic resonance imaging of structural abnormalities in bipolar disorder],&quot; ''Archives of General Psychiatry'', 56:254–60.&lt;/ref&gt; [[prefrontal cortex]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neurotransmitter.net/bipolarpfc.html Prefrontal Cortex in Bipolar Disorder] Neurotransmitter.net.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hippocampus]].

Better understanding of the [[neural circuit]]s involved in regulating mood states, and genetic factors such as the [[cadherin]] gene ''FAT'' linked to bipolar disorder,&lt;ref name=&gt;{{cite web | author = Emma Young | year = 2006 | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn8572&amp;feedId=online-news_rss20 | title = New gene linked to bipolar disorder | work = New Scientist | accessyear = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; may influence the development of new and better treatments, and may ultimately aid in early diagnosis and even a cure.

===New treatments===
In late 2003, researchers at [[McLean Hospital]] found tentative evidence of improvements in mood during echo-[[planar]] [[Magnetic resonance imaging#Magnetic resonance spectroscopy|magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging]] (EP-MRSI), and attempts are being made to develop this into a form which can be evaluated as a possible treatment.&lt;ref name=echo_planar&gt;[http://www.mclean.harvard.edu/research/neuroimaging/bic/mri-bipolar-summaryepmrsi.php LFMS: Low Field Magnetic Stimulation: Original EP-MRSI Study in Volunteers with Bipolar Disorder] McLean Hospital Neuroimaging Center.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rohan_et_al_&gt;{{cite journal | first = Michael | last = Rohan | coauthors = Aimee Parow, Andrew L.

NIMH has initiated a large-scale study at 20 sites across the [[United States]] to determine the most effective treatment strategies for people with bipolar disorder.  This study, the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD), will follow patients and document their treatment outcome for 5&amp;ndash;8 years.  For more information, visit the [[Clinical Trials]] page of the NIMH Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/studies/studies_ct.cfm?id=4 |title=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/studies/studies_ct.cfm?id=4 |accessdate= |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transcranial magnetic stimulation]] is another fairly new technique being studied.

Pharmaceutical research in the United States is extensive and ongoing, as seen at [http://clinicaltrials.gov clinicaltrials.gov].

==Prognosis==
{{Story|date=Aug 2008}}
{{Refimprovesect|date=Aug 2008}}
For some, good [[prognosis]] results from good treatment, which, in turn, results from an accurate [[diagnosis]]. Because bipolar disorder continues to have a high rate of both under-diagnosis and [[misdiagnosis]], it is often difficult for individuals with the condition to receive timely and competent treatment.

Bipolar disorder can be a severely disabling medical condition. However, many individuals with bipolar disorder can live full and satisfying lives. Sometimes medication is needed to enable this. Persons with bipolar disorder are likely to have periods of normal or near normal functioning between episodes.

Ultimately one's prognosis depends on many factors, which may, in fact, be under the individual's control, these may include: the right medicines; the right dose of each; a very informed patient; a good working relationship with a competent medical doctor; a competent, supportive and warm therapist; a supportive family or significant other; and a balanced lifestyle including a regulated stress level, regular exercise and regular sleep and wake times.

There are obviously other factors that lead to a good prognosis as well, such as being very aware of small changes in one's energy, mood, sleep and eating behaviors, as well as having a plan in conjunction with one's doctor for how to manage subtle changes that might indicate the beginning of a mood swing. Some people find that keeping a log of their moods can assist them in predicting changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Introduction|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2004/cmsc434/teams/rise/Introduction.htm|publisher=cs.umd.edu|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functioning===
A recent 20-year prospective study on bipolar I and II has been described as having characterized bipolar by &quot;a low rate of recovery, a high rate of recurrence, and poor interepisodic functioning.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. McIntyre, MD, Joanna K. Soczynska, and Jakub Konarski
&quot;[http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/52016?pageNumber=1 Bipolar Disorder: Defining Remission and Selecting Treatment]&quot; Vol. XXIII, No. 11 (October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the study did not report recovery or recurrence rates but that functioning varied along a spectrum from good to fair to poor, and only with periods of [[major depression]] or mania (in BPI) was it poor; that depression was more persistantly associated with disability than mania; that interepisodic functioning was near normal; and that subsyndromal symptoms were generally still substantially impairing, although subsyndromal and symptom-level hypomania in BPII was associated with improved functioning.&lt;ref&gt;JUDD Lewis L.; AKISKAL Hagop S.; SCHETTLER Pamela J. ; ENDICOTT Jean; LEON Andrew C.; SOLOMON David A.; CORYELL William; MASER Jack D.; KELLER Martin B. (2005) [http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/62/12/1322.pdf Psychosocial disability in the course of bipolar I and II disorders : A prospective, comparative, longitudinal study] Archives of General Psychiatry, vol. 62, no12, pp. 1322-1330 &lt;/ref&gt;

Another study confirmed the seriousness of the disorder as &quot;the standardized all-cause mortality ratio among patients with BD is increased approximately 2-fold.&quot; Bipolar disorder is currently regarded &quot;as possibly the most costly category of mental disorders in the United States.&quot;

===Recovery===
A naturalistic study from first admission for mania or mixed episode (representing the hospitalized and therefore most severe cases) found that 50% achieved syndromal recovery (no longer meeting criteria for the diagnosis) within six weeks and 98% within two years. 72% achieved symptomatic recovery (no symptoms at all) and 43% achieved functional recovery (regaining of prior occupational and residential status). However, 40% went on to experience a new episode of mania or depression within 2 years of syndromal recovery, and 19% switched phases without recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Tohen M, Zarate CA Jr, Hennen J, Khalsa HM, Strakowski SM, Gebre-Medhin P, Salvatore P, Baldessarini RJ. (2003) [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/160/12/2099 The McLean-Harvard First-Episode Mania Study: prediction of recovery and first recurrence] Am J Psychiatry. 2003 Dec;160(12):2099-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recurrence===
The following behaviors can lead to depressive or manic recurrence:
* Discontinuing or lowering one's dose of [[medication]], without consulting one's physician.
* Being under- or over-medicated. Generally, taking a lower dosage of a [[mood stabilizer]] can lead to relapse into mania. Taking a lower dosage of an [[antidepressant]], may cause the patient to relapse into depression, while higher doses can cause destabilization into mixed-states or mania.
* An inconsistent [[sleep]] schedule can destabilize the illness. Too much sleep (possibly caused by medication) can lead to depression, while too little sleep can lead to mixed states or mania.
* [[Caffeine]] can cause destabilization of mood toward irritability, [[dysphoria]], and mania. Anecdotal evidence seems to suggest that lower dosages of caffeine can have effects ranging from anti-depressant to [[mania]]-inducing.
* Inadequate [[stress management]] and poor lifestyle choices. If unmedicated, excessive stress can cause the individual to relapse. Medication raises the stress threshold somewhat, but too much stress still causes relapse.
* Often bipolar individuals are subject to [[self-medication]], the most common drugs being [[alcohol]], and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. Sometimes they may also turn to [[hard drugs]], which can cause the condition to worsen. Studies show that [[tobacco smoking]] induces a calming effect on most bipolar people, and a very high percentage suffering from the disorder smoke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adam.about.com/reports/000066_3.htm Bipolar Disorder&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recurrence can be managed by the sufferer with the help of a close friend, based on the occurrence of idiosyncratic prodromal events.&lt;ref&gt;Perry A, Tarrier N, Morriss R, McCarthy E, Limb K “Randomised controlled trial of efficacy of teaching patients with bipolar disorder to identify early symptoms of recurrence and obtain treatment” BMJ 1999;318:149&amp;ndash;153 ([[16 January]])&lt;/ref&gt; This theorizes that a close friend could notice which moods, activities, behaviours, thinking processes, or thoughts typically occur at the outset of bipolar episodes. They can then take planned steps to slow or reverse the onset of illness, or take action to prevent the episode from being damaging.&lt;ref&gt; Kelly, M., ''Bipolar and the Art of Roller-coaster Riding,'' Two Trees Media 2000, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  These sensitivity triggers show some similarity to traits of a [[highly sensitive person]].

===Mortality===
&quot;Mortality studies have documented an increase in all-cause mortality in patients with BD. A newly established and rapidly growing database indicates that mortality due to chronic medical disorders (eg, cardiovascular disease) is the single largest cause of premature and excess deaths in BD. The [[standardized mortality ratio]] from suicide in BD is estimated to be approximately 18 to 25, further emphasizing the lethality of the disorder.&quot;&lt;ref name=MortBio_2006&gt;{{cite web|title=Bipolar Disorder: Defining Remission and Selecting Treatment| author=Roger S. McIntyre, MD, Joanna K. Soczynska, and Jakub Konarski|publisher=Psychiatric Times, October 2006, Vol. XXIII, No. 11|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/article/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=193400986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many people with bipolar disorder who attempt suicide never actually complete it, the annual average suicide rate in males and females with diagnosed bipolar disorder (0.4%) is 10 to more than 20 times that in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postgradmed.com/issues/2005/02_05/comm_citrome.htm |title=Bipolar disorder is a potentially fatal disease |author=Leslie Citrome, MD, MPH; Joseph F.

Individuals with bipolar disorder may become [[suicidal]], especially during [[Mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed states]] such as [[dysphoric]] [[mania]] and [[agitated depression]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowAbstract&amp;ArtikelNr=88445&amp;Ausgabe=231392&amp;ProduktNr=224276 Psychopathologic Correlates of Suicidal Ideation in Major Depressive Outpatients: Is It All Due to Unrecognized (Bipolar) Depressive Mixed States?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Persons suffering from Bipolar II have high rates of suicide compared to persons suffering from other mental health conditions, including Major Depression. Major Depressive episodes are part of the Bipolar II experience, and there is evidence that sufferers of this disorder spend proportionally much more of their life in the depressive phase of the illness than their counterparts with Bipolar I Disorder (Akiskal &amp; Kessler, 2007).

==History==
{{main|History of bipolar disorder}}
Varying moods and energy levels have been a part of the human experience since time immemorial. The words &quot;[[melancholia]]&quot; (an old word for [[depression (mood)|depression]]) and &quot;mania&quot; have their [[etymologies]] in [[Ancient Greek]]. The word melancholia is derived from ''melas''/μελας, meaning &quot;black&quot;, and ''chole''/χολη, meaning &quot;bile&quot; or &quot;gall&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Liddell 1980&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | id = ISBN 0-19-910207-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicative of the term’s origins in pre-[[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] [[humoral]] theories. Within the humoral theories, mania was viewed as arising from an excess of [[yellow bile]], or a mixture of black and yellow bile. The [[linguistic]] origins of mania, however, are not so clear-cut. Several etymologies are proposed by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] physician [[Caelius Aurelianus]], including the Greek word ‘ania’, meaning to produce great mental anguish, and ‘manos’, meaning relaxed or loose, which would contextually approximate to an excessive relaxing of the mind or soul (Angst and Marneros 2001). There are at least five other candidates, and part of the confusion surrounding the exact etymology of the word mania is its varied usage in the pre-Hippocratic [[poetry]] and [[mythology|mythologies]] (Angst and Marneros 2001).

The idea of a relationship between mania and melancholia can be traced back to at least the 2nd century AD.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} [[Soranus (Greek Physician)|Soranus]] of Ephesus (98&amp;ndash;177 AD) described mania and melancholia as distinct diseases with separate [[etiologies]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Bipolar_disorders_beyond_major_depression_and_euphoric_mania|url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/35176/excerpt/9780521835176_excerpt.pdf|publisher=cambridge.org|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, he acknowledged that “many others consider melancholia a form of the disease of mania” (Cited in Mondimore 2005 p.49).

A clear understanding of bipolar disorder as a mental illness was recognized by early Chinese authors. The encyclopedist [[Gao Lian]] (c. 1583) describes the malady in his ''Eight Treatises on the Nurturing of Life'' (Ts'un-sheng pa-chien).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nmh.gov.tw/nmh_web/english_version/exhibition/exhibition_s0703.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest written descriptions of a relationship between mania and melancholia are attributed to [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]]. Aretaeus was an [[Eclectic medicine|eclectic]] medical philosopher who lived in [[Alexandria]] somewhere between 30 and 150 AD (Roccatagliata 1986; Akiskal 1996). Aretaeus is recognized as having authored most of the surviving texts referring to a unified concept of manic-depressive illness, viewing both melancholia and mania as having a common origin in ‘black bile’ (Akiskal 1996; Marneros 2001).

[[Avicenna]], a [[Islamic medicine|Persian physician]] and [[Islamic psychology|psychological thinker]] who wrote ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' in 1025, identified bipolar disorder as a manic depressive [[psychosis]], which he clearly distinguished from other forms of [[madness]] (''Junun'') such as as [[mania]], [[rabies]], and [[schizophrenia]] (''Junun Mufrit'' or severe madness).&lt;ref name=Dening-57&gt;{{Harvard reference

[[Image:Emil Kraepelin.png|right|thumb|[[Emil Kraepelin]] (1856–1926) refined the concept of [[psychosis]].]]

The basis of the current conceptualisation of manic-depressive illness can be traced back to the 1850s; on [[January 31]], [[1854]], [[Jules Baillarger]] described to the French Imperial [[Academy of Medicine]] a [[biphasic]] [[mental illness]] causing recurrent oscillations between mania and depression, which he termed ''folie à double forme'' (‘dual-form insanity’). Two weeks later, on [[February 14]], [[1854]], [[Jean-Pierre Falret]] presented a description to the Academy on what was essentially the same disorder, and designated ''folie circulaire'' (‘circular [[insanity]]’) by him.(Sedler 1983) The two bitterly disputed as to who had been the first to conceptualise the condition.

These concepts were developed by the German [[psychiatrist]] [[Emil Kraepelin]] (1856&amp;ndash;1926), who, using Kahbaum concept of [[cyclothymia]],&lt;ref name=millon&gt;{{cite book

He coined the term ''manic depressive [[psychosis]]'', after noting that periods of acute illness, manic or depressive, were generally punctuated by relatively symptom-free intervals where the patient was able to function normally.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelin, Emil]] (1921) ''Manic-depressive Insanity and Paranoia'' ISBN 0-405-07441-7 &lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], Dr. [[John Cade]], an Australian [[psychiatrist]], was investigating the effects of various compounds on veteran patients with manic depressive psychosis. In 1949, Cade discovered that [[lithium carbonate]] could be used as a successful treatment of manic depressive psychosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In the 1950s, U.S. hospitals began experimenting with lithium on their patients. By the mid-'60s, reports started appearing in the medical literature regarding lithium's effectiveness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not approve of lithium's use until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The term &quot;manic-depressive ''reaction''&quot; appeared in the first [[American Psychiatric Association]] Diagnostic Manual in 1952, influenced by the legacy of [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]] who had introduced the paradigm illness as a reaction of biogenetic factors to psychological and social influences.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin &amp; Jamison. pp. 60&amp;ndash;61.&lt;/ref&gt; Subclassification of bipolar disorder was first proposed by German psychiatrist [[Karl Leonhard]] in 1957; he was also the first to introduce the terms ''bipolar'' (for those with mania) and ''unipolar'' (for those with depressive episodes only).&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin &amp; Jamison. p62&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, both the newly revised classification systems ICD-8 and DSM-II termed the condition &quot;manic-depressive ''illness''&quot; as biological thinking came to the fore.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin &amp; Jamison. p88&lt;/ref&gt;

The current [[nosology]], bipolar disorder, became popular only recently, and some individuals prefer the older term because it provides a better description of a continually changing multi-dimensional illness.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

[[Kay Redfield Jamison]] is a clinical psychologist and Professor of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who profiled her own bipolar disorder in her [[1995]] memoir ''[[An Unquiet Mind]]'' and argued for a connection between bipolar disorder and artistic creativity in her [[1993]] book, ''[[Touched with Fire]]''.

Several films have portrayed characters with traits strongly suggestive of the diagnosis which have been the subject of discussion by psychiatrists and film experts alike. The 1993 film ''[[Mr. Jones (film)|Mr. Jones]]'' is a notable example, with [[Richard Gere]] playing a person who swings from a manic episode into a depressive phase and back again, spending time in a psychiatric hospital and displaying many of the features of the syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reel Psychiatry:Movie Portrayals of Psychiatric Conditions|author=Robinson DJ |year= |publisher=Rapid Psychler Press |location=Port Huron, Michigan |isbn=1-894328-07-8|pages=p. 78-81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allie Fox, the character played by [[Harrison Ford]] in the 1992 movie ''[[The Mosquito Coast]]'', displays some features including recklessness, grandiosity, increased goal-directed activity and mood lability, as well as some paranoia.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (''Reel Psychiatry:Movie Portrayals of Psychiatric Conditions''), p. 84-85&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pilates Method''' (or simply '''Pilates'''), pronounced  /{{IPA|pɪˈlɑ:ti:z}}/ is a [[physical fitness]] system developed in the early 20th century by [[Joseph Pilates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pilates | first = Joseph | title = Pilates’ Return to Life through Contrology | publisher = Presentation dynamics | location = Incline Village | year = 1945 - Re-released 1998| isbn = 0961493798 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2005 there are 11 million people who practice the discipline regularly and 14,000 instructors in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/21/business/21sbiz.html| title = Now Let Us All Contemplate Our Own Financial Navels | last = Ellin | first = A. | publisher = New York Times| date = [[2005-07-21]] | accessdate = 2007-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilates called his method ''Contrology'', because he believed his method uses the mind to control the muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pilates | first = Joseph | title = Pilates’ Return to Life through Contrology | publisher = Presentation dynamics | location = Incline Village | year = 1945 - Re-released 1998| isbn = 0961493798 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program focuses on the core postural muscles which help keep the body balanced and which are essential to providing support for the [[Vertebral column|spine]].  In particular, Pilates exercises teach awareness of breath and alignment of the spine, and aim to strengthen the deep torso muscles.

==History==

Pilates was formed by [[Joseph Pilates]] during the [[First World War]] with the proposal to improve the rehabilitation program for the many returning veterans. [[Joseph Pilates]] believed mental and physical health are essential to one another. He recommended a few, precise movements emphasizing control and form to aid injured soldiers in regaining their health by strengthening, stretching,and stabilizing key muscles. Pilates created &quot;The Pilates Principles&quot; to condition the entire body: proper alignment, centering, concentration, control, precision, breathing, and flowing movement.

[[Joseph Pilates]] wrote two books concerning the Pilates method, ''Return to Life through Contrology'' (1928) and ''Your Health: A Corrective System of Exercising That Revolutionizes the Entire Field of Physical Education'' (1934).

==Principles==
Pilates claimed his method has a philosophical and theoretical foundation. It claims not merely to be a collection of exercises but a method developed and refined over more than eighty years of use and observation.

===Mind over matter===
According to practitioners, the central aim of Pilates is to create a fusion of mind and body, so that without thinking about it the body will move with economy, grace, and balance. The end goal is to produce an attention-free union of mind and body. Practitioners believe in using one's body to the greatest advantage, making the most of its strengths, counteracting its weaknesses, and correcting its imbalances. The method requires that one constantly pay attention to one's body while doing the movements. Paying attention to movement is seen as so vital that it is considered more important than any other single aspect of the movements.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

===Breathing===
[[Joseph Pilates]] believed in circulating the blood so that it could awaken all the cells in the body and carry away the wastes related to fatigue.  For the blood to do its work properly, he maintained, it has to be charged with oxygen and purged of waste gases through proper breathing. By this standard, if you stop breathing during exercise, there is an error in your practice. Full and thorough inhalation and exhalation are purportedly a part of every Pilates exercise.  Pilates saw forced exhalation as the key to full inhalation.  “Squeeze out the lungs as you would wring a wet towel dry,” he is reputed to have said.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} Pilates breathing should be done with concentration, control, and precision.  Proper and effective breathing, practitioners assert, not only oxygenates the muscles, but also reduces tension in the upper neck and shoulders.  Pilates breathing is described as a posterior lateral breathing, meaning that the practitioner is instructed to breathe deep into the back and sides of his or her rib cage. When the practitioner exhales, they are instructed to note the engagement of their deep abdominal and pelvic floor muscles and maintain this engagement as they inhale.  Pilates attempts to properly coordinate this breathing practice with movement, including breathing instructions with every exercise.  [[Joseph Pilates]] stated, “Even if you follow no other instructions, learn to breathe correctly.”{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

===Centering===
Pilates called the very large group of muscles in the center of the body – encompassing the abdomen, lower back, hips, and buttocks – the “powerhouse.”  All energy for Pilates exercises is said to begin from the powerhouse and flow outward to the limbs.  In other words, the Pilates technique asserts that physical energy exerted from the center should coordinate movements of the extremities.  Pilates felt that it was important to build a strong powerhouse in order to rely on it in daily living.  Modern instructors call the powerhouse the “core”.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

===Concentration===
Pilates demands intense focus.  For instance, the inner thighs and pelvic floor may be assessed when doing a standing exercise that tones the triceps. Beginners are instructed to pay careful attention to their bodies, building on very small, delicate fundamental movements and controlled breathing.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}  In 2006, at the Parkinson Center of the Oregon Health and Science University in [[Portland, Oregon]], the concentration factor of the Pilates method was being studied in providing relief from the degenerative symptoms of [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;MSNBC, ''Pilates may give relief for Parkinson’s patients 2006.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Control===
[[Joseph Pilates]] built his method on the idea of muscle control. To him, that meant no sloppy, uncontrolled movements. Practitioners are instructed to perform every exercise with the utmost control, including all body parts, to avoid injury and produce positive results. In Joseph Pilates' writings, he  very frequently emphasizes not intensity or multiple repetitions of a movement, but proper form for safe, effective results.&lt;ref&gt;Pilates, Joseph (1945 - Re-released 1998). Pilates’ Return to Life through Contrology. Incline Village: Presentation dynamics. ISBN 0961493798.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

===Precision===
Practitioners assert that every movement in the Pilates method has a purpose. Every instruction is considered vitally important to the success of the whole. To leave out any detail is believed to forsake the intrinsic value of the exercise. The focus is on doing one precise and perfect movement, rather than many halfhearted ones. The goal is for this precision to eventually become second nature, and carry over into everyday life as grace and economy of movement. 

All this being said, a qualified Pilates instructor is expected to understand the technique well enough to adapt it to the real-world capabilities of his or her students. Students with physical disabilities, for example, should be given a Pilates regimen intended to improve their methods of physically compensating for their ailment.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

===Flow or efficiency of movement===
Movement is expected to be kept continuous between exercises through the use of appropriate transitions. Once precision has been achieved, the exercises are intended to flow within and into each other in order to build strength and stamina.

==Precautions==

Pilates during pregnancy can be a highly valuable and beneficial form of exercise, but the use of Pilates in pregnancy should only be undertaken under guidance of a fully trained expert.&lt;ref name=&quot;pdf&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/rcm/rcm/2005/00000008/00000005/art00015|title= Pilates and pregnancy|accessyear=2007|accessmonthday=September 11|publisher=Royal College of Midwives|year=2005|author=Royal College of Midwives|work=Volume 8, Number 5, pp. 220-223|format=.pdf|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal action==
In recent years the term “Pilates” worked itself into the mainstream and, following an unsuccessful intellectual property lawsuit, a US federal court ruled the term “Pilates” generic and free for unrestricted use.&lt;ref&gt;US District Court - Southern District of NY,'' Opinion 96 civ. 43 (MGC) October 2000''&lt;/ref&gt;  While this ruling prevented artificial restrictions on the use of the term “Pilates”, it also permitted many untrained or under-qualified practitioners to capitalise on the name.  Consumers may face extensive and conflicting information about what Pilates really is, how it works, and what credentials they should seek in an instructor.&lt;ref&gt;''Wall Street Journal'', “Is your Pilates Instructor a Health Hazard?”, March 15th, 2005 [http://www.stottpilates.com/media/newsletters/2005/april05/news_WallStJournal.pdf],&lt;/ref&gt;
